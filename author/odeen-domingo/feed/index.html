<h3><b>CITY OF MESA AND CO+HOOTS PARTNER TO LAUNCH NEW DIGITAL PLATFORM TO HELP SMALL BUSINESSES AFFECTED BY PANDEMIC</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">CO+HOOTS’ new resource hub re-envisions </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">government technical assistance programs.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Phoenix and Mesa, Ariz: July 13, 2020 — CO+HOOTS, a globally-recognized entrepreneur support organization, today announced the launch of HUUB, a robust digital platform to support local governments in revitalizing small businesses during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. The City of Mesa will be the first to apply this technology driven-approach to business recovery, utilizing CO+HOOTS’ HUUB network to launch the Mesa CARES Technical Assistance Program and Resource Center.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The launch of this digital platform will bring community partner organizations and leaders together to specifically help small businesses in Mesa. In one central place, business owners will have access to engaging and relevant webinars that will provide tactical on-demand solutions, invaluable peer-to-peer groups, funding opportunities and the ability to book on-the-fly sessions with top advisors and consultants. Qualifying Mesa businesses that qualify will receive training, education, and services valued at $15,000 to help them emerge from the pandemic. There are already more than 100 businesses that have applied and been accepted into the Mesa CARES Technical Assistance Program.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Given the strong demand for recovery support due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we&#8217;re excited to see Mesa take an active approach in responding to the needs of their business community” said Jenny Poon, founder and CEO of CO+HOOTS.  “By partnering with the City of Mesa, we aim to improve the resiliency of the business community that is the backbone of Mesa while creating efficiencies for the City. We are excited and prepared to take our decade of experience in incubating entrepreneur communities and be of service in this critical time. With our digital platform, cities and community partners can now provide a faster response to small business owners in need and help cities do more, no matter where they are.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mesa Cares for Small Businesses resource center is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">made possible by the federal Coronavirus Relief Fund under the CARES Act. Many of Mesa’s community partners will be coming together to provide resources to entrepreneurs through this platform including A New Leaf, LISC, Chicanos Por La Causa, Local First Arizona, Mesa Chamber of Commerce, Benedictine University at Mesa, Northern Arizona University and the East Valley Hispanic Chamber.</span><span style="font-size: 20px;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;More than half of small business owners surveyed by the City of Mesa said they were significantly affected by COVID-19,&#8221; Mayor John Giles said. &#8220;The Mesa CARES Small Business Technical Assistance Program serves small business owners by connecting them to the individualized help they need. We are thrilled to partner with CO+HOOTS to offer easy access to quality business support that strengthens Mesa’s economic prosperity.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To qualify for free access to the platform and funding resources, Mesa entrepreneurs and small business owners can apply at </span><a href="https://mesa.joinhuub.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">mesa.joinhuub.com/</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Applications are open right now and are on a first-come, first-serve basis. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">One of HUUB’s main objectives is to directly help entrepreneurs launch, grow and scale their businesses. And because the platform combines CO+HOOTS’ community-building and incubation framework with technology, it also provides the necessary tools for local governments to measure success, manage consultants for technical assistance and make smarter decisions. The detailed reporting and impact tracking gives economic development teams the ability to scale their support through technology and quickly identify the changing needs of their business community, allowing more time to focus on retaining businesses and recruiting new ones.</span></p>

<p>Alex Schmitt learned how to ski before she can spell &#8220;ski&#8221; and is better than you could ever be at soccer.</p>
<p>Yes, we only hire the best of the best.</p>
<p>Learn more about Emily, CO+HOOTS&#8217; content ninintern (ninja intern), and Alex, a design nintern for eeko studio and CO+HOOTS, below!</p>
<h2>Emily Liu</h2>
<p><strong>Age:</strong> 19<br /> <strong>Hometown:</strong> Gilbert, Arizona<br /> <strong>Nickname:</strong> Em<br /> <strong>Why did you want to work at CO+HOOTS?</strong><br /> The company culture was what first drew me in. During my search for a new internship, I found that CO+HOOTS was one of few places that offered a refreshing break from repetitive tasks and cubicle culture. In fact, it was the only place to support a mixture of hands-on and curated learning, yoga breaks and frequent dog sightings. I was definitely looking for a place buzzing with energy and passion. When I realized that CO+HOOTS dedicated being a fully effective community builder and a positive, creative force, I knew I wanted to get involved.</p>
<p><strong>What are your hopes and dreams at CO+HOOTS?</strong><br /> Getting the chance to learn from the CO+HOOTS team is already a dream! Going forth, I&#8217;d especially like to see how the pros plan, strategize and write. I&#8217;d love to network with the other friendly creatives and entrepreneurs in CO+HOOTS too, and contribute to the growth of the coworking space and foundation however I can.</p>
<p><strong>Members in CO+HOOTS may be able to help you as well … What are your own personal hopes and dreams?</strong><br /> I want to launch a blog that profiles ordinary people who allow me to unravel their stories and piece them back together in positive, eloquent pieces that show their uniqueness from my perspective. Think long-form writing and Thought Catalog meets multimedia and Humans of New York. I also hope to keep dabbling in the music industry for as long as possible.</p>
<p><strong>If you had 100 billion dollars, you would …</strong><br /> Jump from city to city, working odd jobs, eating good food and checking off my concert venue bucket list along the way. Adopt lots of pups. Start a nonprofit that gives tour grants to musicians committed to building their local arts community. Buy my mom a cute house. Invest in a cactus nursery.</p>
<p><strong>What should the CO+HOOTS community know about you?</strong><br /> I like to learn new things every day. It&#8217;s important of connect with people through diverse experiences, so I always try to retain bits of knowledge about an odd range of topics, including: seahorses, calligraphy, rat training, cooking, local music and crossword puzzles (&#8216;Oreo&#8217; is a very popular solution). If you&#8217;re willing to teach me something new in exchange for a gift and a handwritten letter, I&#8217;m usually up for it. The stranger the skill the better.</p>
<p><strong>What is one thing people don’t know about you?</strong><br /> I&#8217;m not a coffee snob and I still think people exaggerate the difference between iced coffee and cold brew, but I&#8217;m probably more obsessed with coffee shops than most people. I once traveled 200 miles to try one, and that&#8217;s not an exaggeration.</p>
<p><strong>Why are you so awesome?</strong><br /> I&#8217;m comfortable with exposing all my quirks to people and I&#8217;m never afraid to make jokes at my own expense. My confidence (real or feigned) allows my goof-ups to turn into funny stories, rather than mistakes. If I make an embarrassing face plant at CO+HOOTS one day and you miss it, I&#8217;ll probably be the first to tell you about it.</p>
<p><strong>Scale of 1 to Infinity: How awesome is Odeen?</strong><br /> If he asks, tell him I said infinity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Alex Schmitt</h2>
<p><strong>Age:</strong> 21<br /> <strong>Hometown:</strong> San Jose, California<br /> <strong>Nickname:</strong> Schmitty, which was given to me by one of my soccer teams and has continued to be used over the years.</p>
<p><strong>Why did you want to work at CO+HOOTS?</strong></p>
<p>I automatically was drawn to CO+HOOTS from the moment I walked in the front door. From the people to the set up of the office space, the atmosphere was so inviting from the very beginning. I love the diversity within the office and the feel of community that CO+HOOTS represents.</p>
<p><strong>What are your hopes and dreams at CO+HOOTS?</strong></p>
<p>While at CO+HOOTS, I hope to see my graphic design work used in real world context. I want to explore new aspects of graphic design that are more creative, rather than the corporate graphic design that I have been exposed to in previous internships. I also hope that every day at CO+HOOTS can be a learning experience for my future career.</p>
<p><strong>Members in CO+HOOTS may be able to help you as well … What are your own personal hopes and dreams? </strong></p>
<p>I want to eventually open my own design firm. I especially want to work with startups because I am inspired by the passion behind the creation of startup companies. My dreams are constantly morphing, but this has been something I have been focused on for the couple years.</p>
<p><strong>If you had 100 billion dollars, you would …</strong></p>
<p>support nonprofit organizations bringing education to children all around the world.</p>
<p><strong>What should the CO+HOOTS community know about you?</strong></p>
<p>I love to be outdoors. I love to go on hikes. Being from northern California, I used to hike on a weekly basis and I haven’t be able to do it as much while I’ve lived in Arizona. But I really want to adventure all around Arizona to find new places to explore.</p>
<p><strong>What is one thing people don’t know about you?</strong></p>
<p>Even though I live in Arizona and I’m from California, I love to ski. I learned to ski when I was 2 years old, and I haven’t stopped since!</p>
<p><strong>Why are you so awesome?</strong></p>
<p>I am awesome because I love to make other people feel awesome! I am always very supportive of my friends and family. And I am always there as a helping hand for the people around me.</p>
<p><strong>Scale of 1 to Infinity: How awesome is Odeen?</strong></p>
<p>Infinity! We are easily going to become best friends since we both have a huge love for soccer! <!--codes_iframe--></p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><em>The days of remote positions being purely underpaid telemarketing jobs are gone.</em></p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.studyfinds.org/survey-one-five-office-employees-work-remotely/">One in five people work remotely</a> and over 50% of workers say their company has a work from home policy. What this remote work trend has created is an entirely new workplace lifestyle <em>and a chance for diversification like we have never seen before.</em></p>
<h3>With the ability to recruit from all over the world, we’re in the middle of two major shifts in the workforce.</h3>
<p><strong>Shift One:</strong> Companies have access to talent regardless of location</p>
<p><strong>Shift Two:</strong> Remote workers are having healthier and happier work experiences</p>
<p>InVision, a digital design platform, is looking toward the future and capitalizing on these shifts. They run an entire 700-person team fully remote — and they have been doing so for seven years.</p>
<p>InVision’s Chief People Officer, Mark Frein, told <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/invision-startup-all-employees-work-remotely-2018-9">Business Insider</a> he firmly believes hiring from any location gives InVision an edge as a technology company. Frein isn’t limited to finding talent in New York City and has diversified his workforce to talent around the world. He’s capitalizing on the statistics that show the value of remote workers (<a href="https://biz30.timedoctor.com/remote-workers-infographic/">click here for an infographic on remote work statistics</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li>Ninety-one percent of remote workers get more work done outside of the office</li>
<li>Remote workers are happier with their work than office workers</li>
<li>Remote workers feel more valued at work than office workers</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>“It’s about results, not where your IP address is. We care about what you’re able to do or achieve.” Mark Frein</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Companies like Basecamp, GitLab, Buffer and Splice have also embraced a fully remote team. Basecamp’s founder Jason Fried, transcribed his remote working business strategy into a best-selling book in 2009, <em>Rework</em>. In his book, he explained how remote work was an integral part of his company’s success.</p>
<p><strong>With only a remote team, Fried has amassed over three million Basecamp users.</strong></p>
<p>As the founder of <a href="https://cohoots.com/">CO+HOOTS</a>, a nationally ranked coworking office based in Phoenix, I watch business owners capitalize on having remote teams on a daily basis.</p>
<p>When it comes to innovation and closing business deals, the businesses capitalizing on the freedom that remote work provides are winning.</p>
<p><strong>The future of the workforce is here and this is how to capitalize on the opportunity of remote work.</strong></p>
<h3>Work Environment Will Be A Priority</h3>
<p>When working remotely, the work environment can vary from a table in a coffee shop, to a desk in a local library. Or, for some, it can be sitting in pajamas on the living room couch with your trusty cat pawing at your arm.</p>
<p>Josh Johnson, Senior Product Manager at Dribbble, runs a 50-person remote team from a coworking office. His experience with a remote team taught him that work environments aren’t a cookie cutter template, but a functioning part of an employee’s life. If employers can provide employees with the chance to find the optimal work environment, employers become catalyst to their employees’ health, productivity and longevity instead of inhibitors to their potential.</p>
<p><em>“No single way to work is appropriate for everyone. Some people are mentally and emotionally drained by sitting in a bustling, open office environment for nine hours every day. Others feel the same way about sitting alone at a desk in their home. Some people need to get away from their house to focus and be productive, others are happiest when they can take a 2pm conference call and enjoy a quick after school snack with their kids at 3pm.</em></p>
<p><em>We all win when we stop having tweet wars over which way is better and realize that the best possible job market is one that provides diverse opportunities to all types of people in all types of situations.”</em></p>
<p>The future of remote work depends on employers supporting their employees work productivity, no matter what form it takes.</p>
<p>Companies should take an interest in their employees’ remote office. Some are now providing laptops or a desktop computer. Others are giving stipends for home office furniture like standing desks. Even scheduling a weekly grocery delivery order to keep remote employees energized and healthy.</p>
<h3>Lower Overhead than Traditional Office Space</h3>
<p>All businesses are looking to create higher levels of happiness and lower their bottom line. Very rarely has the two ever come in one package, that is until coworking came around. Coworking space memberships often start at only $99 a month for individuals and allows companies to scale their team quickly and efficiently. This includes fast Wifi, utilities, office equipment, cleaning fees, access to networking events, free parking and more. Not to mention the biggest benefit — helping employees not feel so isolated. The overhead of a typical office is upwards of $3,000 not inclusive of all the utilities, maintenance, furniture and taxes. Keeping employees happy? Priceless.</p>
<p>Josh Padnick of Phoenix-based <a href="https://www.gruntwork.io/">Gruntwork</a> employs 14 remote workers and offers coworking as an employee benefit.</p>
<p><em>“We pay for everyone on our team to use a coworking space if they wish, and about half our team uses the benefit. The reality is that working from home all day every day, and then remaining at home at night can be draining and uninteresting. We also crave the in-person human connection and serendipity that comes from being in a physical workplace. Coworking is a great way to provide these things. You get the physical community, and yet your coworkers are distributed.”</em></p>
<p>Josh (full disclosure: he is a member at CO+HOOTS) spends 80% less revenue on office space than a traditional team does. When these savings are redirected to employee health and training, as well as business development, we see why remote teams are able to scale so quickly. Most spaces offer free trials for a day or a week, which give remote employees the opportunity to decide whether to see if being around other highly efficient workers helps them feel more efficient.</p>
<p>Coworking spaces are the done-for-you office space with professional development built in.</p>
<h3>Work Will No Longer Be 9–5</h3>
<p>The idea of the 9–5 work week is becoming less and less popular among employers. We’re finally realizing, <em>it’s not necessary.</em></p>
<p>Richard Branson recently wrote a piece <a href="https://www.virgin.com/richard-branson/way-we-all-work-going-change">on the future of the workplace</a>: “five days a week with two day weekends and a few weeks of holiday each year has become ingrained in society. However, it wasn’t always the case, and it won’t be in the future.”</p>
<p>Virgin happily applies an atypical work week with its employees and allows them to take off two months if they believe they need to.</p>
<p>The typical work schedule is an antiquated idea of how businesses should run. In most cases, there is no need for an employee to come in at a set period. Even more so, it would bode well for their health if they didn’t. Commuting to a job during “rush hour” is becoming increasingly stressful. Missing out on picking kids up for school does not equate to a great work-life balance. We have as a society switched from working hard to working smart and becoming a workforce that values measuring results over measuring time. It makes sense that 9–5 is dead.</p>
<h3>Hire for Diverse Opinions and Cultural Backgrounds</h3>
<p>What if each problem in your business was looked at by three experts with various backgrounds? Instead of getting the same answer three times, you’d have a variant of answers depending on the past experience of your experts.</p>
<p>The location agnostic factor of remote work means each of your experts stands on a different foundation. They all know the same information and can implement the same strategies but they may come to the project with three perspectives, three prior experiences and three ideas on solving any roadblocks along the way.</p>
<p>Diversity of opinions and cultural backgrounds is what Stephen Olmstead, Chief of Staff at <a href="https://www.invisionapp.com/">InVision</a>, attributes to the team’s ability to problem solve.</p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p>CO+HOOTS member Mike Wolfson, principle of Able Android, was recently selected to participate in the Google Developer Experts Program as an Android development expert. Wolfson joins just one other Android GDE in North America; and 11 others worldwide. <a href="https://cohoots.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/android_gde_2014.png"><img class="alignright wp-image-6741 size-thumbnail" src="https://cohoots.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/android_gde_2014-150x150.png" alt="android_gde_2014" width="150" height="150" /></a></p>
<p>&#8220;I am honored to be associated with the GDE and the other experts in the program,” Wolfson said. “It is surreal to see my name next to those superstars.&#8221; Mike commented.”</p>
<p>Google Developer Experts (GDEs) are experts in one or more Google developer technologies. Google Developers Experts speak in local and global events, have a strong online presence and an excellent technical background in their field. These independent developers bring their real-world experience and knowledge working with Google technologies to developer communities worldwide.</p>
<p>Wolfson is a passionate mobile designer/developer who has been working in the software field for 20 years, and with Android since its introduction. Currently, he works as a Lead Mobile Developer in the health care field for Epocrates. He has a few successful apps in the Play Store and is an active contributor to the tech community, including organizing GDGPhoenix, and authoring a book from O&#8217;Reilly Publishing titled &#8220;Android Developer Tools Essentials.&#8221; He has spoken at a variety of conferences and user groups (including Oscon and AnDevCon). When he is not geeking out about phones, he enjoys the outdoors (snowboarding, hiking, scuba diving), collecting PEZ dispensers, and chasing his young (but quick) daughter.</p>
<p><a href="https://cohoots.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Goopordy.jpg"><img class="alignright wp-image-6748 size-medium" src="https://cohoots.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Goopordy-300x225.jpg" alt="Goopordy" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p>He will be presenting next at the national OSCON Open Source Convention in Portland Oregon on July 22, 2014.</p>
<p>He hosts the GDGPhoenix Android Developer Meetup on the fourth Wednesday of every month at CO+HOOTS (1027 E. Washington St. Suite 107, Phoenix). The event is free and open to the public. The next GDG Android Meetup is on June 25 at 6:30 p.m. More event information can be found at <a href="http://www.meetup.com/phx-android" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://www.meetup.com/phx-android</a>. <!--codes_iframe--></p></div>

<p><strong>Why did you want to work at CO+HOOTS?</strong><br /> When I first heard about the co-working space here at CO+HOOTS I was impressed by the sense of community that Jenny and Odeen had created. I instantly wanted to be a part of it and spread the word about the community here. Being a part of a team that is passionate about growing local business is a perfect fit for me.

<p><strong>What should the CO+HOOTS community know about you?</strong><br /> I am extremely driven to create positive energy. I love to get people to smile back at me even if they don&#8217;t expect it. I will make your day brighter if it kills me! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p><strong>What is that one big project you&#8217;d like to do? In CO+HOOTS or out of CO+HOOTS?</strong><br /> I would love to have new art monthly or bi-monthly in the space. We could have a gallery event to introduce the artist and the work to the space. It might get some new faces for coworking too.</p>
<p><strong>What is one thing people don&#8217;t know about you?</strong><br /> I have roosters and chickens that live in my front yard. They&#8217;re not mine. Dozens of them just live on our street. We feed them every day. So we basically trained them to come running to us when we open our front door.</p>
<p><strong>Why are you so awesome?</strong><br /> I love food. I eat bacon and cheese on everything and then I get in a 100 degree room and do yoga to punish myself for it. I am really passionate about animal and marine life preservation. I am loyal to a fault and I never give up. I would do anything for my friends, they are my family.</p>
<p><strong>Who&#8217;s more awesome &#8230; Jenny? Or Odeen?</strong><br /> I think the two of you together are awesome. <!--codes_iframe--></p></div>
