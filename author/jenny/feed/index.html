				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p class="graf graf--p">We are facing two infections. COVID and SYSTEMIC RACISM. Both require a deconstruction of every aspect of our lives to properly combat. Let’s look at how our government responded to COVID at a city level. Here in Phoenix our city split up into teams, all tackling different issues.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Some teams worked on supporting small biz, some on education, some on social services, discussions on how police need to enforce safety measures, close convos with health department etc. Together a plan was hatched to quickly address the many challenges that come with a massive epidemic. The result was rapid response, support and even reform. Grants were launched at a local level, regulations were loosened to allow faster production of a vaccine. People were sent money. We reshaped an entire federal loan program and reclassified applicants so more could apply. Conversely, SYSTEMIC RACISM VIRUS has led to thousands of deaths annually and a consistent backwards mobility of an entire population. The government has had one strategy: suppression. Led by our tyrant president, our government activated military, curfews and attempt to control the story.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">One virus attacks fast with a 2% fatality rate and can be clearly seen. The other is silent, slower and has rooted itself in every single human on our planet. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-06/race-and-police-shootings-what-new-research-says">The latter also results in black people being 2.5x likely to be shot</a> and one in three going to prison. If we aren’t addressing the systemic racism virus that has infected us all like the public health issue it is, then we aren’t treating it at all. We have seen how quickly government can shift and apply support under a pandemic, the same approach should be taken.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="graf graf--p"><span style="font-size: 20px;"><em><strong>The latter also results in black people being 2.5x likely to be shot and one in three going to prison.</strong></em></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="graf graf--p">This racism pandemic has affected every sector of our society, from education to economics, from police enforcement to public policy. From our innovation ecosystem to our internet infrastructure. It all slants to support the division and marginalization of black communities. While it may seem impossible to tackle racism in America, I’m confident if we took the same approach we took with COVID we’d move the needle. Divide up into teams, collaborate, identify one small change you can make every day and collectively we will push the boulder up the hill.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Every government/industry/biz/individual should assess what role it has played in creating the inequities that exist and begin devising plans to attack this virus so it doesn’t mutate to a new strain. First step, is realizing it is a man-made virus and we are all infected.</p>

<p>CO+HOOTS has always believed businesses in the community have a voice and should use that voice to take a stance. We are a part of the community and strive to uphold our community’s values and basic rights. As a minority-owned organization that is deeply rooted in diversity and inclusion with a mission to support the underrepresented, CO+HOOTS stands in solidarity with Black communities and recognizes the pressing significance and necessity of the #BlackLivesMatter movement. As a stakeholder in the health of our community’s economy, we know our innovation ecosystem would not thrive without the leading-edge contributions of our Black community.</p>
<p>Our hearts are hurting and furious over the continuing acts of violence against our Black communities in the United States, and most recently, the senseless murders of Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery and George Floyd. May they rest in peace, love and power. True justice must be served. This isn’t about minimizing other communities&#8217; struggles. Those need to be uplifted, too. But the long history of police violence against Black communities is just part of the immense breadth of injustices Black communities experience in this country, no matter the system.</p>
<p>Our hearts hurt, but our spirit isn’t broken. There is so much that can be done to become better allies,  spread awareness and take action to disrupt racial injustices. We hope you join us. We will be sharing what we all can do to become a better ally at whatever level you are currently comfortable in, such as listening to, uplifting and amplifying Black voices and experiences; and confronting racial injustices you encounter in your professional and personal networks even when uncomfortable, especially among family and friends.</p>

Read Part 2 <a href="https://cohoots.com/2020/04/10/businesses-tactics-in-a-covid19-world-part-2-generating-revenue/">here.</a> </span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8212;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of us have felt a little useless as we’ve holed up in our homes. As our first responders and medical professionals help those infected, what can the rest of us do after we’re done binging Netflix and eating our fourth round of takeout? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I begin thinking about America, post-COVID, I am excited about all that needs to be done for our cities. Yes, things look and likely will be dire. That also means there is opportunity to start anew in what will be a different economic landscape. I think my fellow entrepreneurial friends who survived the last recession are starting to feel this itch too — the landscape is ripe for rebuilding and it is our job to do it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nothing brings us together like a common enemy. And that enemy is not human, it’s COVID-19. There are a few things you can do to start contributing to the rebuilding of our economy, I encourage you to first think about strengthening yourself. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Self-Care</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a person who is a quick starter but is constantly anxious, I take time to center myself by continuously reinvesting in myself. To be ready for what’s to come, you need to have the right mindset and have the correct knowledge and skills; or at least a basic understanding of what will be needed. Here are some ideas to tackle this type of Self-Care:</span></p>
<ul>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Future</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If we start working now, we can structure a future that makes sense for so many more people. If we, as rebuilders, had the opportunity to create a version of the world that worked better, what would it look like? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Would retail/restaurants have more reasons to begin building businesses that live beyond physical walls, while also finding solutions to somehow create the experience people still crave from your establishments? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Would educators develop new education models that serve all learning styles while giving our teachers more support resources to nurture tomorrow’s innovators?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Would our leaders of consultancies redefine what and how our work is done? Pass a national standard for maternity leave or minimum wage?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Would startups develop a business model that isn’t only defined by back-breaking growth or IPOs, but by impact, which in turn, will still positively affect your bottom line?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Would housing be built to support all income levels?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Can we elect officials without them selling their values to the highest bidder?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For entrepreneur support organizations like mine at CO+HOOTS, can we challenge the existing model of entrepreneurship by making it possible for more people to own and thrive in business?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It takes courage to take action when the whole world seems to be falling apart. But if there is ever a time to fake courage, it is now. </span></p>

<p>&#8212;-</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The trick to effectively pivoting your business to generate new income still comes down to the basics &#8212; knowing your customer market and what they need. Restaurants and service-based businesses that used technology to build their online business or successfully streamlined operations before the mandated shutdown have bought themselves a few additional months of survival.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In times of crisis, needs shift regularly so never stop listening and gathering information. Most people are wary of spending right now, so how can you utilize your time to build trust until customers are ready? Or is there something else that customers need right now versus what you’re selling? Or do they need what you’re selling, but need to buy and receive it differently than how it’s being done now?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So what does that all look like? Here are some ideas, which may lead you to realize how you could be running much leaner with more margins. </span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Start a prepay program if you know you can deliver services/products later. Some restaurants are marketing discounted catering packages that can be used at a later date. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be honest with the help you need. Five years ago, a local paper shutdown without notice and hundreds of people said they would have chipped in to support the paper if it had just let people know HOW they needed help. Your customers can help you figure out new models. Be open to feedback. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider new ways to sell. Do you have products or services that could be easily sold differently? For example, law firms are shifting from hourly rates to packaged rates to help businesses negotiate their leases. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead of losing a customer altogether because of the crisis, consider a temporary discounted rate. Gusto, a payroll company, has offered to defer fees by three months, knowing that many companies may have to layoff their employees. With the discount, Gusto hopes to retain those companies as customers. but if they can retain customers, it’s better than losing them.  </span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After two weeks of operating a delivery-only business for their restaurant in Minneapolis, my parents have seen a large uptick in sales. Their revenue is not as high as it was before, but this new process has made operations easier for a couple in their 70s. They are now seriously considering permanently shifting their business model to takeout only. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t Count on Customers Only</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortunately, business-to-business companies are jumping in to help those who are still looking to improve their sales and operations. Almost all the food delivery networks (Uber Eats, Grubhub, DoorDash) are waiving their fees to help their restaurant partners generate more revenue during the COVID-19 outbreak. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can check other discounts and business tool freebies here: </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Local communities are also launching campaigns to further support local businesses. The Arizona Restaurant Association has launched Take Out Week (</span><a href="https://arizonarestaurantweek.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://arizonarestaurantweek.com/</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). The Arizona Asian Chamber of Commerce has also started a campaign to support Asian run businesses called #takeoutthursday. Restaurants can promote these types of local events to bring in more orders. You may want to check your local business associations/coalitions to see what groups are coming together to support mainstreet businesses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The federal government’s massive CARE stimulus bill is a huge parachute to many small businesses impacted by COVID. Beyond the $1,200 stimulus check that will be coming to anyone who makes under $75k/year, there are two loan products for small businesses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Payroll Protection Program (PPP) loan is forgivable if companies maintain payroll, comes with a </span><b>fixed 1% interest rate </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">and has a loan cap of 2.5x your monthly payroll costs with a </span><b>2-year</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> term. The second loan option is the Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDJ) loan, which has </span><b>a 3.75% interest </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">rate and allows for a loan amount of up to $2 million over a 30-year term. But this loan is not forgivable</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lot of organizations have launched grant programs to help small businesses during COVID. Local First Arizona has started a micro-grant program (</span><a href="https://www.localfirstaz.com/small-business-relief-fund"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.localfirstaz.com/small-business-relief-fund</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) and the state has a list of resources that small businesses can apply for. (</span><a href="https://www.azcommerce.com/covid-19/business-financial-support/?fbclid=IwAR1B1I5djG_MuiVhebZGLtOrcFXwLA16Sm7yvvfiw4t_cGKUBSq8WMB0r30"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.azcommerce.com/&#8230;/business-financial-support/</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). Again check your own local community to find additional support. </span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re stuck, reach out. CO+HOOTS is hosting weekly financial/legal information sessions to support personalized guidance during this time.

<p>&#8212;-</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thirty-eight years ago, my parents opened Camdi Restaurant, a small Chinese-Vietnamese restaurant named after my mom in downtown Minneapolis. It has been open consistently until two weeks ago when, for the first time ever, the restaurant was mandated to close dine-in service. My parents have since lost nearly 75% of their income. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I caught up with my mom that evening, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I realized there is so much she should be doing. But no one is guiding her as a small restaurant owner. Add on language barriers and not used to asking for help (a cultural trait), her challenges are compounding.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I asked if she has requested help from her utility company, or from the banks that carry any of the loans she had. “No,” she said, “I don’t even know how I would start doing that. Can I do that?” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The story is similar to many other small business owners I’ve chatted with over the last week. The panic is real and, unfortunately, government support is still several weeks out. I fear we are facing the mass decimation of our main street businesses if we don’t help them make changes now, especially those from underrepresented communities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am not a financial expert or legal advisor, but I founded a coworking/incubator space called CO+HOOTS in the middle of the last recession and have supported nearly a thousand entrepreneurs over the last decade, of those businesses 80% survived the last recession and have grown and thrived. While not comprehensive to all businesses, I hope the following steps can be helpful to many mainstreet businesses who may be paralyzed, questioning if they need to prepare to close their doors and just walk away or hang in a little longer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An overwhelming weight of uncertainty hangs over us all, myself included, but there are steps to weather this storm and potentially even benefit from it. Together, my mom and I worked on the tactical steps she could implement immediately to buy her some time until the government’s stimulus package rolls out or until she could work out a new revenue model. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We talked through her highest expense items and identified next steps to lower her burn rate. You can find the worksheet we quickly put together in the link below. If you’re like mom, you also needed some guidance on how to negotiate with partners. With the help of Amber Cordoba, manager of consulting services for Chicanos Por La Causa, the following script was developed to help small businesses with beginning the discussions. Feel free to take, edit and revise for your needs. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hello [NAME], As you may know, my business [BIZ NAME] was mandated to close due to COVID-19. This has caused an incredible loss of business resulting in financial hardship in a very short amount of time. We’ve seen an xx% loss of revenue since [DATE] and are doing everything we can to maintain operations and mitigate costs. I’m reaching out to see if [COMPANY/NAME] has any ability to help me in this difficult time. I can likely [INSERT OFFER/ASK — Could be 50% reduction, a 2-3 month deferral, interest only payments, to cancel a subscription, revenue share, or just ask for help and let them respond]. This would allow us to keep employees paid until we can pivot to new revenue strategies. Thank you in advance.</span></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">PART 1: Mitigate costs</span></h2>
<p><b>(Estimated time to complete: 1 hour)</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Begin by listing all your expenses and addressing what areas can be negotiated down, waived or canceled. Now is the time to get lean. If you’re lean already, get leaner. You want to be the ground beef that is only 2% fat (which is ironically more expensive).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. List all your business expenses. It might be easiest to start with your biggest expenses first.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Main columns: Category, Monthly Cost, Action, Notes. Your “Actions” should be either: Freeze/Pause, Renegotiate, Cancel, or Keep.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Once you’ve documented your expenses, prioritize your most expensive costs (you should sort the columns now). Begin your emails, calls, outreach to these vendors to lower or eliminate costs. Track these in the “Action” column. </span></p>
<p><b>Pro Tip:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> You can negotiate everything. Are you renting or paying utilities to your city municipality? City of Tempe has done a great job of quickly finding ways to support small businesses like abating all rent on property they own.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Staff, this is a tough one. No one wants to let staff go, but if you don’t have customers, you can’t sustain staff. </span></p>
<p><b>Pro Tip: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pay payroll tax first, this tax comes with the highest fees if you miss it. </span></p>
<p><b>Note: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The federal government’s new stimulus package includes small business loans that can be forgiven if you keep your staff on payroll through June, keep watching the news as information is being released daily. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Check if your vendors and partner costs can be lowered. Are you paying for software or services you won’t be using through this crisis? (Ex. do you pay a monthly fee for banking or payroll?)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">5. Map the projected new expenses against the projected new revenue (for my parents, they suddenly saw a drop of 75% of their revenue) and see if you get in the black. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do this again for your personal expenses. (Student loans? Car payments? Home loans? Utility bills? Internet bills?) Reducing your personal expenses will help you also stay afloat. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lastly, as you begin negotiating or canceling with vendors, partners and staff, realize everyone is struggling. Your hope is to get leeway where you can from people who can give you that. Realize not everyone can. Patience and empathy are required from all right now if we are to get through this together.</span></p>

<p>Weeks after mandated closures of small businesses due to COVID-19, the SBA has released several loan programs to support small businesses in this critical moment. The two most popular loan products are the SBA <strong>Payroll Protection Program (PPP)</strong> which is run through individual banks and the <strong>Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL)</strong> which the SBA is directly managing. This walkthrough takes you through the things you need to have ready to attack the EIDL loan.</p>
<p><img id="image-3-1" class="" src="https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/2020-04/CON-SBA_Pandemic_Icon-Left-Aligned-13.png" alt="Circle with document in it and text that says 10,000 dollars." width="293" height="143" data-testid="card image" /><img id="image-3-0" class="" src="https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/2020-04/CON-SBA_Pandemic_Icon-Left-Aligned-09.png" alt="Image of shield with money in it." width="284" height="142" data-testid="card image" /></p>
<p>There are a few major differences between the two programs, but the biggest differences are the PPP loan is a forgivable loan based on payroll, while the EIDL offers a 10k advance (grant) if your loan application is accepted.</p>
<h2><strong>Before you start</strong></h2>
<p>Before you get started on the EIDL application you will need to have the following items ready to fill in. If it is easier we have developed a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eNIUMWfZzsWci69WUCZeWMpLtY7T7PiQdtKclNf9mBs/edit?usp=sharing">google doc</a> for you to fill in your answers so when you&#8217;re ready to fill out the online application you can just copy and paste your responses. The EIDL application does not require any uploading of documents, just honest answers. I am sure the SBA will then follow up with you directly.</p>
<p>Before starting, make sure you have the following ready:</p>
<ul>
<li>EIN of your business</li>
<li>Incorporation date</li>
<li>Gross sales from Jan 30, 2019 to Jan 30, 2020</li>
<li>Cost of goods from Jan 30, 2019 to Jan 30, 2020</li>
<li>Legal name, SSN, phone number, addresses and contact information for all owners of the company</li>
<li>Name, phone, address of a representative you want the SBA to talk to if they need further help. *This might be helpful if English is your second language or if you have a CPA that is working with you that can answer more finance-related questions.*</li>
</ul>
<p>Watch the video walkthrough below before filling out your own application to make sure you don&#8217;t miss anything.</p>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><span>The glamour surrounding Silicon Valley belies a toxic work ethic, set in place by myths created in the tech boom of the 90s and cemented by the web boom of the 2000s.</span></p>
<p><span>Among the side effects of that fantasy? Millennials are entering the workplace with unrealistic and unsustainable attitudes on what being part of a startup means. … If you’re not working at all hours of the day, you’re not committed. … Only bro-grammers will make it big.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>All, wrong. </span></p>
<p><span>So, let’s put our hoodies away, take off our sustainably sourced sneakers and talk about what successful startup life is really like.</span></p>
<p><span></span></p>
<h2>THE LIES OF SILICON VALLEY</h2>
<h3><span></span></h3>
<h3><span>LIE #1: “FAKE IT UNTIL YOU MAKE IT.”</span></h3>
<p><span>Let me be clear, no one wants to hire someone who seems stymied and terrified by their workplace. But too many graduates enter the workforce riding a wave of bloated credentials, hoping if they bury their inexperience in enough buzz words, the HR manager won’t be able to separate fact from fiction. </span></p>
<p><span>What makes the “fake it until you make it” mantra so flawed is that while you can fake confidence, you can’t fake your competencies (at least not for long). When you misrepresent yourself, you set yourself up to erode the trust of anyone who invests in you. </span></p>
<p><span>Authenticity must be your core, whether it’s your resume or your business model. The days of bro-culture in tech and the “Old-white-guys Only” world of entrepreneurship are running out faster than bottled water at the FYRE Festival (that reference will not age well). </span></p>
<h3><span>LIE #2: YOU MUST SIGN YOUR LIFE OVER TO THE STARTUP</span></h3>
<p><span>A 40-hour week?!? Not in Silicon Valley pal! </span></p>
<p><span>Don’t feel like working nights and weekends? </span></p>
<p><span>One of those weak-willed sissies who want to see their spouses, kids or friends every day? </span></p>
<p><span>TOO BAD! </span></p>
<p><span>This is the world of startups. And in this world, no one sleeps and everyone is miserable until they instantly become gazillionaires. </span></p>
<p><span>This mindset must stop, not only for the good of your team but the good of startup culture.</span></p>
<p><span>Being married to your desk is a recipe for burnout and brain drain. Additionally, without a social life, you run the risk of disconnecting from your product’s users and startup investors. Some of our most valuable research is done simply by living in the world we seek to improve.</span></p>
<p><span></span></p>
<h3><span>LIE #3: &#8220;STARTUP&#8221; MEANS PROGRAMMING&#8221;</span></h3>
<p><span>Tech mastery is an important component of creating a scalable tech-based company, but it’s not the only important skill. </span></p>
<p><span>Tech skills are definitely an accelerating component. But most ideas are not unique because of the tech. They’re unique because of the solutions. </span></p>
<p><span>VRBO, for example, solves the problem of helping people find vacation rentals. The solution itself can be solved without tech, but tech allows for more people to access it. Success in startups depends on the innovation and the skills and backgrounds of those who develop solutions for it. You may notice once again this destroys the “fake it til’ you make it” myth.</span></p>
<p><span>A vision for something that can change the scope of an industry is not solely the realm of engineers and developers. Core competencies that are on par with or outrank programming expertise in building a startup include marketing, sales (Mark Cuban), finance (Mike Bloomberg), user experience (Steve Jobs) and product management (Interesting Name Not Found). </span></p>
<p><span>Rather than possessing one core skill (such as writing code), successful entrepreneurs possess a combination of skills and surround themselves with experts and culture motivators that accelerate the execution of their vision. </span></p>
<h3><span></span></h3>
<h3><span>WHY NOT FOLLOW THE EXAMPLE OF SILICON VALLEY?</span></h3>
<p><span>Our needs are different, our infrastructure is different and our definition of success is different. We must prioritize community building. We must include an examination of our unique population. We must consider community projects already in production (eg: mass transit, universities, a more walkable downtown). </span></p>
<p><span>The Valley of the Sun is attempting to employ an entirely different kind of entrepreneur, engineer and innovator. In fact, tier 2 cities and emerging markets are becoming way more attractive to talent and a massive migration is beginning. People are choosing a different path than the above hustle and grind expectations. The workforce is demanding freedom — financial freedom, social freedom to manage to their time, and the freedom to choose what drives them. These are the key benefits of being in an emerging city. Not only is the cost of living incredibly affordable so is the ability to live in/near urban areas, where most business opportunities often cluster. These things are all possible in markets where cities are allowed to take risks and be different. Where we aren’t chasing what we could be, but are comfortable owning that we are a bit nerdy and are the only ones who think it’s a dry heat. But really it is.</span></p>
<p><span>When the goals and priorities of Millennials and GenZ do not match those of Boomers and Gen X, how could we imagine the tactics would?</span></p>
<p><span>So let Silicon Valley be Silicon Valley and let Phoenix be Phoenix. </span></p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><em>The days of remote positions being purely underpaid telemarketing jobs are gone.</em></p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.studyfinds.org/survey-one-five-office-employees-work-remotely/">One in five people work remotely</a> and over 50% of workers say their company has a work from home policy. What this remote work trend has created is an entirely new workplace lifestyle <em>and a chance for diversification like we have never seen before.</em></p>
<h3>With the ability to recruit from all over the world, we’re in the middle of two major shifts in the workforce.</h3>
<p><strong>Shift One:</strong> Companies have access to talent regardless of location</p>
<p><strong>Shift Two:</strong> Remote workers are having healthier and happier work experiences</p>
<p>InVision, a digital design platform, is looking toward the future and capitalizing on these shifts. They run an entire 700-person team fully remote — and they have been doing so for seven years.</p>
<p>InVision’s Chief People Officer, Mark Frein, told <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/invision-startup-all-employees-work-remotely-2018-9">Business Insider</a> he firmly believes hiring from any location gives InVision an edge as a technology company. Frein isn’t limited to finding talent in New York City and has diversified his workforce to talent around the world. He’s capitalizing on the statistics that show the value of remote workers (<a href="https://biz30.timedoctor.com/remote-workers-infographic/">click here for an infographic on remote work statistics</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li>Ninety-one percent of remote workers get more work done outside of the office</li>
<li>Remote workers are happier with their work than office workers</li>
<li>Remote workers feel more valued at work than office workers</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>“It’s about results, not where your IP address is. We care about what you’re able to do or achieve.” Mark Frein</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Companies like Basecamp, GitLab, Buffer and Splice have also embraced a fully remote team. Basecamp’s founder Jason Fried, transcribed his remote working business strategy into a best-selling book in 2009, <em>Rework</em>. In his book, he explained how remote work was an integral part of his company’s success.</p>
<p><strong>With only a remote team, Fried has amassed over three million Basecamp users.</strong></p>
<p>As the founder of <a href="https://cohoots.com/">CO+HOOTS</a>, a nationally ranked coworking office based in Phoenix, I watch business owners capitalize on having remote teams on a daily basis.</p>
<p>When it comes to innovation and closing business deals, the businesses capitalizing on the freedom that remote work provides are winning.</p>
<p><strong>The future of the workforce is here and this is how to capitalize on the opportunity of remote work.</strong></p>
<h3>Work Environment Will Be A Priority</h3>
<p>When working remotely, the work environment can vary from a table in a coffee shop, to a desk in a local library. Or, for some, it can be sitting in pajamas on the living room couch with your trusty cat pawing at your arm.</p>
<p>Josh Johnson, Senior Product Manager at Dribbble, runs a 50-person remote team from a coworking office. His experience with a remote team taught him that work environments aren’t a cookie cutter template, but a functioning part of an employee’s life. If employers can provide employees with the chance to find the optimal work environment, employers become catalyst to their employees’ health, productivity and longevity instead of inhibitors to their potential.</p>
<p><em>“No single way to work is appropriate for everyone. Some people are mentally and emotionally drained by sitting in a bustling, open office environment for nine hours every day. Others feel the same way about sitting alone at a desk in their home. Some people need to get away from their house to focus and be productive, others are happiest when they can take a 2pm conference call and enjoy a quick after school snack with their kids at 3pm.</em></p>
<p><em>We all win when we stop having tweet wars over which way is better and realize that the best possible job market is one that provides diverse opportunities to all types of people in all types of situations.”</em></p>
<p>The future of remote work depends on employers supporting their employees work productivity, no matter what form it takes.</p>
<p>Companies should take an interest in their employees’ remote office. Some are now providing laptops or a desktop computer. Others are giving stipends for home office furniture like standing desks. Even scheduling a weekly grocery delivery order to keep remote employees energized and healthy.</p>
<h3>Lower Overhead than Traditional Office Space</h3>
<p>All businesses are looking to create higher levels of happiness and lower their bottom line. Very rarely has the two ever come in one package, that is until coworking came around. Coworking space memberships often start at only $99 a month for individuals and allows companies to scale their team quickly and efficiently. This includes fast Wifi, utilities, office equipment, cleaning fees, access to networking events, free parking and more. Not to mention the biggest benefit — helping employees not feel so isolated. The overhead of a typical office is upwards of $3,000 not inclusive of all the utilities, maintenance, furniture and taxes. Keeping employees happy? Priceless.</p>
<p>Josh Padnick of Phoenix-based <a href="https://www.gruntwork.io/">Gruntwork</a> employs 14 remote workers and offers coworking as an employee benefit.</p>
<p><em>“We pay for everyone on our team to use a coworking space if they wish, and about half our team uses the benefit. The reality is that working from home all day every day, and then remaining at home at night can be draining and uninteresting. We also crave the in-person human connection and serendipity that comes from being in a physical workplace. Coworking is a great way to provide these things. You get the physical community, and yet your coworkers are distributed.”</em></p>
<p>Josh (full disclosure: he is a member at CO+HOOTS) spends 80% less revenue on office space than a traditional team does. When these savings are redirected to employee health and training, as well as business development, we see why remote teams are able to scale so quickly. Most spaces offer free trials for a day or a week, which give remote employees the opportunity to decide whether to see if being around other highly efficient workers helps them feel more efficient.</p>
<p>Coworking spaces are the done-for-you office space with professional development built in.</p>
<h3>Work Will No Longer Be 9–5</h3>
<p>The idea of the 9–5 work week is becoming less and less popular among employers. We’re finally realizing, <em>it’s not necessary.</em></p>
<p>Richard Branson recently wrote a piece <a href="https://www.virgin.com/richard-branson/way-we-all-work-going-change">on the future of the workplace</a>: “five days a week with two day weekends and a few weeks of holiday each year has become ingrained in society. However, it wasn’t always the case, and it won’t be in the future.”</p>
<p>Virgin happily applies an atypical work week with its employees and allows them to take off two months if they believe they need to.</p>
<p>The typical work schedule is an antiquated idea of how businesses should run. In most cases, there is no need for an employee to come in at a set period. Even more so, it would bode well for their health if they didn’t. Commuting to a job during “rush hour” is becoming increasingly stressful. Missing out on picking kids up for school does not equate to a great work-life balance. We have as a society switched from working hard to working smart and becoming a workforce that values measuring results over measuring time. It makes sense that 9–5 is dead.</p>
<h3>Hire for Diverse Opinions and Cultural Backgrounds</h3>
<p>What if each problem in your business was looked at by three experts with various backgrounds? Instead of getting the same answer three times, you’d have a variant of answers depending on the past experience of your experts.</p>
<p>The location agnostic factor of remote work means each of your experts stands on a different foundation. They all know the same information and can implement the same strategies but they may come to the project with three perspectives, three prior experiences and three ideas on solving any roadblocks along the way.</p>
<p>Diversity of opinions and cultural backgrounds is what Stephen Olmstead, Chief of Staff at <a href="https://www.invisionapp.com/">InVision</a>, attributes to the team’s ability to problem solve.</p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p>Working with 700 people from around the world means that Stephen’s team isn’t built on the foundation of one person’s experience. It’s built on the foundation of 700. Which foundation sounds sturdier?</p>
<p><strong>The future of the workforce is going to consist of happier workers that are location independent and aren’t hindered by their socioeconomic status, gender or race.</strong></p>
<p>Companies will enjoy the benefits reaped when workers aren’t forced to show up to an uninspiring cubicle-laden dungeon with barely any windows after sitting in hours of traffic. They’ll see more innovation by hopping on a Zoom call for a team meeting and seeing the variety of faces on the screen, all with new experiences and ideas from their varying locations of the world.</p>
<p>Companies comprised of an inclusive and diverse workforce that supports happy workers is the future of work we all deserve.</p>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><em>“Power is not given to you. You have to take it.”</em> -Beyonce</p>
<p>The topic of women in leadership has never trended harder in human history. With the digital age came an influx of information that started to shed light on major cultural problems. Data is widely spread and it has become household knowledge that the dream of equality isn’t nearly as close as we hoped. It’s opened the door for new conversations.</p>
<p>You can find several articles that tackle gender inequality of leadership positions in business. This article is different. Instead, I’m going to focus on the lessons women already in leadership have provided and can provide to other women who are just starting their career. Let’s leverage everything we have today to accelerate what we want to accomplish as women in business.</p>
<p><strong>These are the five must-know lessons from women in leadership about becoming a leader.</strong></p>
<h3>Master Your Internal Dialogue — be true to yourself as you would with a friend</h3>
<p>Arianna Huffington is one of the founders of The Huffington Post, which sold to AOL in 2011 for $315 million dollars.</p>
<p>During her rise to the top, she discovered a major difference between herself and her male counterparts. This difference can be seen in researched evidence that women may internalize stress more than men.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Women in stressful jobs have a 40 percent greater risk of heart disease, and a 60 percent greater risk of diabetes. We internalize stress. We need to change that.</p>
<p>We need to stop listening to that voice that I call the obnoxious roommate in our head, that judges us and doesn’t think we’re doing everything perfectly, so that we can be a little easier on ourselves. That will help us deal with stress better.” (<a href="https://www.chase.com/news/020818-leadership-lessons-women">Source</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How can women, and men, avoid causing themselves stress from the internal dialogue that runs through their mind?</p>
<p><strong>By asking themselves one question: Would I talk to my friend the way that I talk to myself?</strong></p>
<p>As Arianna points out, our internal dialogue can be detrimental to our personal health and professional development. <em>Elevate yourself, don’t bully yourself.</em></p>
<h3>You can’t be what you can’t see — seek out the female leaders in your community</h3>
<p>Dona Sarkar is the Head of the Windows Insider Program. She is one of the most influential members of the Windows team, yet she never imagined she’d be able to reach such a massive milestone in her career.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“When I was growing up in Detroit, if someone had told me, ‘Hey Dona, you’re going to be making a really, really great salary working at Microsoft as a very senior person,’ I would have just hysterically laughed.” (<a href="https://medium.com/thrive-global/dream-it-do-it-own-it-confidence-coaches-cd4a6235530">Source</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dona attributes laughing at the thought of such success to her lack of female mentorship. When she was growing up, she didn’t see any women in high leadership positions and so, she didn’t imagine that she had the potential within herself to pull it off.</p>
<p>Suelin Chen, a PhD graduate from MIT in Materials Science and Engineering and former executive at the Lab@Hardvard says, “<em>You have to see it to be it</em>.”</p>
<p><strong>Where can you see more women in leadership positions?</strong></p>
<p>-Online Interviews (Youtube Videos, Podcasts, etc.)</p>
<p>-Conferences and Meetups (<a href="https://www.ellevatenetwork.com/">Ellevate Network</a>, <a href="http://girlsintech.com/">Girls in Tech</a>, etc.)</p>
<p>-Mentorship Programs (For example, <a href="https://www.millionwomenmentors.com/">Million Women Mentors</a> or <a href="https://elpha.com/">Elpha via Y-Combinator</a>)</p>
<h3>Self Promotion Is Not Only Okay, It’ll Elevate You — promote your skillset</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=602736208&amp;fref=gc&amp;dti=245786539205302">Natalia Ronceria Ceballos</a> is the founder and CEO at LA NRC. She is an advocate for women proudly promoting their skill sets.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Don’t be afraid to ask the big asks!! We still so often undervalue ourselves in negotiations and end up making less than our counterparts doing the same level of work.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Self promotion isn’t a dirty phrase. It’s the opportunity to showcase the skillset that our commitment has chiseled from stone.</p>
<p><strong>How can women promote themselves without feeling over-promotional?</strong></p>
<p>-Talk about achievements through recognizable metrics — You’ve achieved it, it’s okay to talk about it</p>
<p>-Create a specific goal to speak at X amount of conferences and teach your skillset in the upcoming year</p>
<p>-Write about achievements on social platforms like Medium and Quora</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Don’t be afraid to ask the big asks!! We still so often undervalue ourselves in negotiations and end up making less than our counterparts doing the same level of work.” —Natalia Ronceria Ceballos</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Don’t Buy Into The Hustle — figure out work/life schedule that works best for you</h3>
<p>The idea of hustle became a trending topic in the last few years, highlighting the need to work 12+ hour days in the name of your passion. In hindsight, the business world has come to see the lack of scalability of this mindset.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The research is clear: beyond about 40–50 hours per week, the marginal returns from additional work decrease rapidly and quickly become negative,” Dustin Moskovitz, Facebook Co-Founder (<a href="https://www.dailydot.com/via/work-life-balance-amazon-tech-culture/">source</a>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Instead of buying into the hustle, what if we bought into freedom?</strong></p>
<p>The hustle isn’t defined by 12+ hour days, it’s defined by choosing the schedule that allows you to be a savvy business women while maintaining relationships, personal development and health (and the same goes for men).</p>
<p>This schedule maintains long term freedom and the ability to adapt to it changing at any moment is where leaders rise. Hustling for harmony between your schedule and the spontaneity of life is the new definition of “the grind”.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=602736208&amp;fref=gc&amp;dti=245786539205302">Natalia Ronceria Ceballos</a> says, “<em>And forget about work/life balance, I’ve always thought that was deceiving, not everything will get equal shares of your time, talent, &amp; treasure always (family, work, etc) — so strive for harmony, knowing sometimes family will need more of you, sometimes work will, and that is OK</em> <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f917.png" alt="🤗" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2764.png" alt="❤" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />”</p>

<p>Michelle Phan, YouTube creator and entrepreneur, saw the future of YouTube when the platform was in its infant stage. She talks about this foresight in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Geek-Girl-Rising-Sisterhood-Shaking/dp/1250112265">Geek Girl Rising</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I knew that the younger generation would see YouTube as the new TV. They [would] come across my channel and … see a library of hundreds of videos. They’re going to want to watch it.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Her videos now have over a billion views, she has launched multiple product lines, and is now a published author. Currently, she is still focused on the future of the content industry and how she can be on the brink of the attention economy as technology continues to change social behavior.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If you want to be a great creator, you have to be your own number one fan first. You have to love what you’re doing. Ten years ago I saw a glimpse of what I wanted to be the future of digital content. If I wanted that to come true, I had to manifest it myself by also making it myself.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>What is happening in your industry right now and what are the options for what comes of it in the future?</strong></p>
<p>The digital revolution has opened the door to a conversation regarding equality. Now, it’s time to walk through the door and change the conversation.</p>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p>Coffee shops made their rise in the era of remote work. What was once a place to meet with friends has transformed into a place flooded with business people taking meetings, signing contracts and heads down trying, unsuccessfully, to get things done amidst blaring music. All the while, your butt is sore from sitting in painful chairs all day.</p>
<p>Jason Fried, founder of Basecamp and author of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Rework-Jason-Fried/dp/0307463745">Rework</a>, a #1 Best Selling book in Business, was one of the first CEOs to decide that having a remote team was more impactful than a location-dependent team. His book, written in 2010, focuses on the rise in remote work and how businesses can use it to amplify their results. Fried was ahead of the curve. In 2017, Basecamp’s net worth hit $100 million.</p>
<p>In a recent <a href="https://www.upwork.com/press/2017/10/17/freelancing-in-america-2017/">press release</a>, freelance platform Upwork revealed that freelancers are predicted to make up more than 50% of the U.S. workforce within the next decade.</p>
<p><strong>This decoupling of “work” and “office” has helped created a new trend in work friendly coffee shops that established something better.</strong></p>
<p><em>Coworking spaces.</em></p>
<p>One major differentiator between coffee shops and coworking spaces are amenities. A coffee shop can provide you with a cup of coffee and a scone in return for access to their WiFi. Most coworking spaces give unlimited coffee and tea (often from your favorite local place anyway!), snacks, private conference areas, innovative business equipment, free access to business events, and a network of business leaders to rub shoulders with all for the same, if not less cost, as that cup of coffee. But there’s more.</p>
<p><strong>Here are the five benefits of working in a coworking space instead of a coffee shop.</strong></p>
<h3>Coworking spaces help you create work-life harmony.</h3>
<p>A recent study by <a href="https://gcuc.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/GCUC-Global-Coworking-Stats-2017-2022.pdf">Emergent Research</a> found that more than 80% of coworking space members feel generally happier after they joined a coworking space. One of the biggest reasons entrepreneurs get divorced is the inability to separate work from life. As more workers enter the remote workforce, this problem will become more problematic as there is no more 9–5 schedule, nor visual queue that it’s time to stop. Couples have stated coworking helped create a home/work balance that simmers those workaholic-type tendencies. Don’t get me wrong. I am typing this at 10pm on a Sunday. Sometimes we’ve got to get things done when we are most effective. This is the benefit of being a remote worker or entrepreneur. We just need to be careful about letting it consume us. Being able to separate and leave work at work, was standard when we had an office to clock in to. But now we need to learn self discipline in managing our time and making room for more than just work. Sometimes we just need a physical space to remind us of that. That being said, I’m going to take a quick coffee break. BRB.</p>

<h3>Coworking spaces have private areas for Zoom/Skype/Phone Calls.</h3>
<p>Espresso machines and conference calls don’t mix well. The harsh whirring noise of the espresso machine and the often abrupt noise of several conversations taking place make coffee shops a difficult setting for an important call. Coworking spaces offer private, quiet and soundproof Zoom/Skype/Phone call rooms to maximize the efficiency and professionalism of phone calls and video conferences. Instead of apologizing for distracting background noise, coworking members can focus on their conversation and extract what actions they need to accomplish their next objective.</p>
<h3>Coworking spaces provide members the latest in workspace innovation.</h3>

<h3>Coworking spaces give members free access to professional, personal and technical growth events.</h3>
<p>CEO’, founders and c-suite executives seem to all have the same advice for remote workers and new business owners. <em>You’re not alone. Stop trying to do everything on your own.</em> Most coworking spaces give members access to educational events that can accelerate their productivity and business scalability. If you’re just starting out and are looking for someone to talk to, coworking spaces are huge cheerleaders for you. Many spaces offer free programming and classes to accelerate you through any hurdles you might be facing. We host more than 350 a year focused on specific business topics, but other spaces might specialize in other topics like cyber security, monetizing blogs, etc. Business leaders and remote workers who learn, profit ten fold.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“You are the average of the five people you spend the most time around. If all of those people were thriving business leaders, how would your life change?”</em></p>

<h3>Coworking spaces are a network of hustling business leaders with insights and advice.</h3>
<p>Let’s face it. Remote work sounded awesome when you first started. Now it’s really freaking lonely. The network of amazing people that flock to coworking spaces is one of the biggest reasons coworking spaces are lapping coffee shops in benefits for remote workers and the business community in general. When remote workers are surrounded by a diverse group of talented and skilled professionals from different industries, the knowledge sharing over a lunch and off-the-cuff brainstorming sessions improves business, professional and personal development. I promise you, what you are struggling with today, is not new. It is not unique to you. But how do you get through it? Find someone who has been through it. Where do you find someone who has been through it? I’ll let you think about that one.</p>
<p>You are the average of the five people you spend the most time around. If all of those people were thriving business leaders, how would your life change?</p>
<p>Coffee shops as an alternative workplace made their rise, but then they plateaued. The value they can provide to the new location-independent workforce starts with fancy coffee and ends with a cranberry scone. The value coworking spaces can provide is transforming businesses around the world.</p>
