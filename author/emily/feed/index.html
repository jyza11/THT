				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p>Getting started as an entrepreneur can seem like a daunting task, but taking initiative and being willing to learn can lead to a chain reaction of incredible results. We built our internship program to help students reach their entrepreneurial goals, regardless of industry, and gain a community of supporters to help them succeed. We&#8217;re proud to bring on board a new ninja intern who exemplifies the proactive spirit of entrepreneurship.</p>
<h3>Meet Jeron Artest</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-15616" src="https://cohoots.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_6676-1024x683.jpg" alt="Jeron Artest ninja intern" width="456" height="304" /></p>
<p>Jeron Artest joins our team as our new nintern for the fall and spring semesters, and we can&#8217;t wait to see what he accomplishes.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re already incredibly impressed by Jeron&#8217;s wisdom and determination, and he&#8217;s already on his way toward his major career goals. He is a high school student who already knows how to code, recently traveled to China to further his basketball dreams and is committed to achieving the goals he has set for himself.</p>
<h5>His goals:</h5>
<ul>
<li>Learn how to work within a team in an office</li>
<li>Work on different projects to improve/hone programming skills and learn new skills</li>
<li>Networking with others in the same/similar field</li>
<li>Event planning</li>
</ul>
<h5>Why he wanted to work at CO+HOOTS:</h5>
<p>I wanted to work at CO+HOOTS to personally experience the inner workings of a business while also being exposed to other businesses at the same time. It&#8217;s just such a perfect experience. Also, I like dogs, and there are a lot of office dogs here.</p>
<h5>What he believes makes a community successful:</h5>
<p>A community is successful when everyone supports each other unconditionally, whether it&#8217;s by pointing them towards the right direction or personally assisting each other.</p>
<h5>Why he believes being proactive at a young age is important:</h5>
<p>By being proactive at a &#8220;young&#8221; age, you&#8217;ll make your life easier. It&#8217;s like procrastinating on an assignment. If you do it too late, it might not be as good as if you did it early. Being proactive doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean finding a job right now or taking extra hard classes. It can be as simple as going to meetups, or contacting people on LinkedIn or even Twitter. It all benefits your future without all the stress of being an adult.</p>
<h3>Five tips for students to reach their goals by Jeron</h3>
<p>At CO+HOOTS, we believe that age does not have to be a barrier to achieving big goals. We support our our nonprofit arm <a href="http://cohootsfdn.org">CO+HOOTS Foundation</a>&#8216;s efforts to help high school students like Jeron bring their ideas to life at <a href="http://ycmsummit.com">Youth Changemaker Summit</a> and beyond. Sometimes, achieving goals starts with a few simple actions, including these tips written by Jeron:</p>
<p>1. Learn all the things. Any knowledge is the best knowledge.</p>
<p>2. Do what you love so you make the most of your time.</p>
<p>3. Find people who have similar interests to yours. Networks are important.</p>
<p>4. Communicate. It helps everyone around you and yourself understand what&#8217;s going on.</p>
<p>5. Write down your goals and a rough roadmap you can take to reach them.</p>
<h3>Jeron beyond the coworking space</h3>
<h5>Hometown:</h5>
<p>I was born in New York, New York, but I consider home to be Los Angeles.</p>
<h5>What are your own personal hopes and dreams?</h5>
<ul>
<li>Become an entrepreneur</li>
<li>Own several (mainly software-based) businesses; creating/exiting; repeat</li>
<li>Turn current concepts into actual revenue-generating businesses</li>
<li>Become an NBA player</li>
</ul>
<h5>What should the CO+HOOTS community know about you?</h5>
<p>I love trying new types of food. I always try to find a unique place to eat wherever I travel.</p>
<h5>What is one thing people don&#8217;t know about you?</h5>
<p>Nobody knows that I practice yoga.</p>
<h5>Why are you so awesome?</h5>
<p>I am so awesome because I am always learning new things. <!--codes_iframe--></p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><strong>Hometown:</strong> Tempe, AZ</p>
<p><strong>Why did you want to work at CO+HOOTS?</strong></p>
<p>I fell in love with Jenny Poon&#8217;s work and applied for an internship. Honestly, I wasn&#8217;t sure I would be working in such a welcoming environment. I love it here.</p>
<p><strong>What are your hopes and dreams at CO+HOOTS?</strong></p>
<p>At the moment, I am working towards my degree, but I have thought of starting up a company with my best friend once or twice. I hope to build the confidence and the experience that could help me consider making that dream a reality.</p>
<p><strong>Members in CO+HOOTS may be able to help you as well&#8230; What are your own personal hopes and dreams?</strong></p>
<p>My personal hopes and dreams are for travel. I want to go as many places as possible for both work and play. 3D Art is a personal passion of mine and with my graphic design degree, I hope to work with my hands, constantly building in the physical 3D space as well as the Virtual 3D space.</p>
<p><strong>If you had a 100 billion dollars, you would&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>HAH, probably blow it all on silly things. I&#8217;m terrible with money&#8230; Honestly though, I would probably invest in property. Everybody needs a place to rest their head, right? But 100 billion is a lot of money.</p>
<p><strong>What should the CO+HOOTS community know about you?</strong></p>
<p>Umm&#8230; I work at the zoo on the weekends?</p>
<p><strong>What is the one thing people don&#8217;t know about you?</strong></p>
<p>When I first started my Facebook profile, I set my birthday as April 1 as an April Fools prank for those who got the notification. I thought it was funny at the time.</p>
<p><strong>Why are you awesome?</strong></p>
<p>I am a sucker for puns. <!--codes_iframe--></p></div>

His openness to exploring (and admitting) any and all passions is why he fits our culture so well, but his ability to #GSD is the reason why it&#8217;s such a pleasure to have him as one of our ninterns! Did you know Jeremy has already built a custom app for us?</p>
<p>Josh Hanson is a design extraordinaire with an eye for all things branding. Whether it&#8217;s hands-on work or something on the screens, he&#8217;s prepared to help and ready to learn (and probably ready to climb on furniture for the sake of design). We&#8217;re excited to see more of Josh&#8217;s amazing work &#8212; and what his next tattoo may be!</p>

<p><img class="wp-image-14861 alignright" src="https://cohoots.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_5299-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="434" height="289" /></p>
<p><b>Hometown:</b> Glendale, AZ</p>
<p><strong>Why did you want to work at CO+HOOTS?</strong></p>
<p>I am in love with what this space and the Foundation provides to its members and what it stands for. Working on a small team with a shared responsibility to enable people to chase their passions is a no-brainer for me. Very excited to be chosen for the internship this summer and to have a chance to contribute to the community!</p>
<p><strong>What are your hopes and dreams at CO+HOOTS?</strong></p>
<p>I hope to learn all the things! And to contribute wherever I can to make things more efficient, more accessible and more helpful.</p>
<p><b>Members in CO+HOOTS may be able to help you as well… What are your own personal hopes and dreams?</b></p>
<p>My ideal dream would be to one day end up at NASA or SpaceX building software for space exploration. On a more down to Earth level (teehee), I want to help solve all kinds of difficult problems with technology, whatever language or platform that takes me to. Anyone working in the software or web development world that is willing to share their story would be a true hero of mine!</p>
<p><b>If you had 100 billion dollars, you would…</b></p>
<p>That&#8217;s an insane amount of money for a single person to have, so I&#8217;d put away 100 million or so to comfortably live off of and then spend the rest of my life giving the remainder away.</p>
<p><b>What should the CO+HOOTS community know about you?</b></p>
<p>I&#8217;m currently a full-time college student studying Computer Science. I spent 14 years working for a large financial firm in Scottsdale (my first real job ever!) and decided it was time to pursue my dream of being a software developer. Scary and exciting!</p>
<p><b>What is one thing people don’t know about you?</b></p>
<p>I&#8217;m secretly not awesome. Also, I have an unhealthy obsession with Funko Pop figures which has only recently been hampered by the whole full-time college student thing.</p>
<p><b>Why are you so awesome? </b></p>
<p>Well this is awkward&#8230;</p>
<h3>Josh</h3>

<p><strong>Why did you want to work at CO+HOOTS? </strong></p>
<p>I heard amazing things about Eeko Studio/CO+HOOTS through a classmate at school, so I had to check it out. It has been awesome learning about how CO+HOOTS helps entrepreneurs and the community.</p>
<p><strong>What are your hopes and dreams at CO+HOOTS?</strong><br /> I would love to help the any design aspect the team may need. I love print work, branding and making prototypes with my hands.</p>
<p><strong>Members in CO+HOOTS may be able to help you as well&#8230; What are your own personal hopes and dreams?</strong></p>
<p>I would love to learn many different aspects of graphic design from the various team members while interning here. Also to make great connections with my fellow team members, but also the CO+HOOTS members.</p>
<p><b>If you had 100 billion dollars, you would…</b></p>
<p>Most people would say they would stop working, but I&#8217;m not that person. Of course I wouldn&#8217;t work too much, but I love to travel so I would definitely spend some time traveling the world. A hundred billion dollars is a lot of money, so I would of course share some with charities. I just try and live a simple life. I&#8217;m a no frills kind of guy.</p>
<p><b>What should the CO+HOOTS community know about you?</b></p>
<p>I love to travel and have been to many places here in the U.S. and in Europe. Feel free to ask me any questions. I also love dogs, the bigger the better. Oh, and macaroni and cheese is my favorite food.</p>
<p><b>What is one thing people don’t know about you?</b></p>
<p>I have a total of 12 tattoos.</p>
<p><b>Why are you so awesome? </b></p>
<p>There are many reasons why I&#8217;m awesome! I have tattoos, I&#8217;m a graphic designer, I get along with just about anyone and I&#8217;m a &#8220;go with the flow&#8221; kind of guy. <!--codes_iframe--></p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><em>The days of remote positions being purely underpaid telemarketing jobs are gone.</em></p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.studyfinds.org/survey-one-five-office-employees-work-remotely/">One in five people work remotely</a> and over 50% of workers say their company has a work from home policy. What this remote work trend has created is an entirely new workplace lifestyle <em>and a chance for diversification like we have never seen before.</em></p>
<h3>With the ability to recruit from all over the world, we’re in the middle of two major shifts in the workforce.</h3>
<p><strong>Shift One:</strong> Companies have access to talent regardless of location</p>
<p><strong>Shift Two:</strong> Remote workers are having healthier and happier work experiences</p>
<p>InVision, a digital design platform, is looking toward the future and capitalizing on these shifts. They run an entire 700-person team fully remote — and they have been doing so for seven years.</p>
<p>InVision’s Chief People Officer, Mark Frein, told <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/invision-startup-all-employees-work-remotely-2018-9">Business Insider</a> he firmly believes hiring from any location gives InVision an edge as a technology company. Frein isn’t limited to finding talent in New York City and has diversified his workforce to talent around the world. He’s capitalizing on the statistics that show the value of remote workers (<a href="https://biz30.timedoctor.com/remote-workers-infographic/">click here for an infographic on remote work statistics</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li>Ninety-one percent of remote workers get more work done outside of the office</li>
<li>Remote workers are happier with their work than office workers</li>
<li>Remote workers feel more valued at work than office workers</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>“It’s about results, not where your IP address is. We care about what you’re able to do or achieve.” Mark Frein</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Companies like Basecamp, GitLab, Buffer and Splice have also embraced a fully remote team. Basecamp’s founder Jason Fried, transcribed his remote working business strategy into a best-selling book in 2009, <em>Rework</em>. In his book, he explained how remote work was an integral part of his company’s success.</p>
<p><strong>With only a remote team, Fried has amassed over three million Basecamp users.</strong></p>
<p>As the founder of <a href="https://cohoots.com/">CO+HOOTS</a>, a nationally ranked coworking office based in Phoenix, I watch business owners capitalize on having remote teams on a daily basis.</p>
<p>When it comes to innovation and closing business deals, the businesses capitalizing on the freedom that remote work provides are winning.</p>
<p><strong>The future of the workforce is here and this is how to capitalize on the opportunity of remote work.</strong></p>
<h3>Work Environment Will Be A Priority</h3>
<p>When working remotely, the work environment can vary from a table in a coffee shop, to a desk in a local library. Or, for some, it can be sitting in pajamas on the living room couch with your trusty cat pawing at your arm.</p>
<p>Josh Johnson, Senior Product Manager at Dribbble, runs a 50-person remote team from a coworking office. His experience with a remote team taught him that work environments aren’t a cookie cutter template, but a functioning part of an employee’s life. If employers can provide employees with the chance to find the optimal work environment, employers become catalyst to their employees’ health, productivity and longevity instead of inhibitors to their potential.</p>
<p><em>“No single way to work is appropriate for everyone. Some people are mentally and emotionally drained by sitting in a bustling, open office environment for nine hours every day. Others feel the same way about sitting alone at a desk in their home. Some people need to get away from their house to focus and be productive, others are happiest when they can take a 2pm conference call and enjoy a quick after school snack with their kids at 3pm.</em></p>
<p><em>We all win when we stop having tweet wars over which way is better and realize that the best possible job market is one that provides diverse opportunities to all types of people in all types of situations.”</em></p>
<p>The future of remote work depends on employers supporting their employees work productivity, no matter what form it takes.</p>
<p>Companies should take an interest in their employees’ remote office. Some are now providing laptops or a desktop computer. Others are giving stipends for home office furniture like standing desks. Even scheduling a weekly grocery delivery order to keep remote employees energized and healthy.</p>
<h3>Lower Overhead than Traditional Office Space</h3>
<p>All businesses are looking to create higher levels of happiness and lower their bottom line. Very rarely has the two ever come in one package, that is until coworking came around. Coworking space memberships often start at only $99 a month for individuals and allows companies to scale their team quickly and efficiently. This includes fast Wifi, utilities, office equipment, cleaning fees, access to networking events, free parking and more. Not to mention the biggest benefit — helping employees not feel so isolated. The overhead of a typical office is upwards of $3,000 not inclusive of all the utilities, maintenance, furniture and taxes. Keeping employees happy? Priceless.</p>
<p>Josh Padnick of Phoenix-based <a href="https://www.gruntwork.io/">Gruntwork</a> employs 14 remote workers and offers coworking as an employee benefit.</p>
<p><em>“We pay for everyone on our team to use a coworking space if they wish, and about half our team uses the benefit. The reality is that working from home all day every day, and then remaining at home at night can be draining and uninteresting. We also crave the in-person human connection and serendipity that comes from being in a physical workplace. Coworking is a great way to provide these things. You get the physical community, and yet your coworkers are distributed.”</em></p>
<p>Josh (full disclosure: he is a member at CO+HOOTS) spends 80% less revenue on office space than a traditional team does. When these savings are redirected to employee health and training, as well as business development, we see why remote teams are able to scale so quickly. Most spaces offer free trials for a day or a week, which give remote employees the opportunity to decide whether to see if being around other highly efficient workers helps them feel more efficient.</p>
<p>Coworking spaces are the done-for-you office space with professional development built in.</p>
<h3>Work Will No Longer Be 9–5</h3>
<p>The idea of the 9–5 work week is becoming less and less popular among employers. We’re finally realizing, <em>it’s not necessary.</em></p>
<p>Richard Branson recently wrote a piece <a href="https://www.virgin.com/richard-branson/way-we-all-work-going-change">on the future of the workplace</a>: “five days a week with two day weekends and a few weeks of holiday each year has become ingrained in society. However, it wasn’t always the case, and it won’t be in the future.”</p>
<p>Virgin happily applies an atypical work week with its employees and allows them to take off two months if they believe they need to.</p>
<p>The typical work schedule is an antiquated idea of how businesses should run. In most cases, there is no need for an employee to come in at a set period. Even more so, it would bode well for their health if they didn’t. Commuting to a job during “rush hour” is becoming increasingly stressful. Missing out on picking kids up for school does not equate to a great work-life balance. We have as a society switched from working hard to working smart and becoming a workforce that values measuring results over measuring time. It makes sense that 9–5 is dead.</p>
<h3>Hire for Diverse Opinions and Cultural Backgrounds</h3>
<p>What if each problem in your business was looked at by three experts with various backgrounds? Instead of getting the same answer three times, you’d have a variant of answers depending on the past experience of your experts.</p>
<p>The location agnostic factor of remote work means each of your experts stands on a different foundation. They all know the same information and can implement the same strategies but they may come to the project with three perspectives, three prior experiences and three ideas on solving any roadblocks along the way.</p>
<p>Diversity of opinions and cultural backgrounds is what Stephen Olmstead, Chief of Staff at <a href="https://www.invisionapp.com/">InVision</a>, attributes to the team’s ability to problem solve.</p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p>Working with 700 people from around the world means that Stephen’s team isn’t built on the foundation of one person’s experience. It’s built on the foundation of 700. Which foundation sounds sturdier?</p>
<p><strong>The future of the workforce is going to consist of happier workers that are location independent and aren’t hindered by their socioeconomic status, gender or race.</strong></p>
<p>Companies will enjoy the benefits reaped when workers aren’t forced to show up to an uninspiring cubicle-laden dungeon with barely any windows after sitting in hours of traffic. They’ll see more innovation by hopping on a Zoom call for a team meeting and seeing the variety of faces on the screen, all with new experiences and ideas from their varying locations of the world.</p>
<p>Companies comprised of an inclusive and diverse workforce that supports happy workers is the future of work we all deserve.</p>

<b>We don’t have Daylight Saving Time in our vocabulary.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Why let an hour go to waste when you could be getting so much done? Whatever you do, don’t follow your instinct to set your clock. We won’t even think to warn you before you show up an hour late to work.</span> <b>We’re the place innovators are flocking to.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Our entrepreneurs have won awards from </span><a href="https://www.ces.tech/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CES</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><a href="https://www.cohootsfdn.org/youthstartup"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our foundation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> gives young innovators a taste of the startup world.

<h3><b>Things you should know</b></h3>
<p><b>We often forget how unnecessarily dramatic our weather is. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">It went from 50 to 80 degrees on February 10? The sun must have come out. Flash flood? It’s just monsoon season. Getting swallowed by a demonic cloud of dust? That’s your average haboob.</span> https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153820604203230&amp;set=p.10153820604203230&amp;type=1&amp;opaqueCursor=Abr_Q_KlElF8CT8FDEWPsIepvRYyZxBx_964PCC_KhCyFQYPde4ujwpsPCJiH3J6-sX5rkUXFc1ftDnGU4ajW3Vqk_ejY9xCYEOPLL66EUi0sIGtpuvrgzW6QTfNTD6mkecwMCCck-QMi5OlgrB357yyWdOVTTdXNl-GTy84DbiTVxvfGoptyqRNZGxh1pDOn3tQklYFdU5ab1BvYAZGg7eMXUdaw-srtvYR41eNBX1_tR_5ZGP6QOmXBC9ybyeu4CcRR01cfWUY_mpYQTzASKZ_pD27L_pbkuW8L3HOTlDW4yUnLuXVcaAnCpf2tDoDz-RoEJMqXsKFKcgBqiyL3kcliP4AsnuXhY15w66omf0zP3md9JcWj0p2T3WOrNI8lQqM45jVtpBAV6Vy7UfM-I_3iSgUYVmHxhve6xPc1N1qrA&amp;theater   <b>We might as well have canned responses when talking about weather.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “It’s dry heat.” “It’s a desert.” “Under 70 degrees?

<h3><b>Things we want you to know</b></h3>
<p><b>We have all the biomes of the world in our state.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> From the San Francisco Peaks tundra to the arid desert everyone imagines we live in, diverse landscapes can be found all throughout Arizona – including one of the Seven Wonders of the World.

<p><b>We’re home to the best pizza city in America.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Phoenix earned the title in 2017 for promoting peace and respect for pizza of all forms, while Chicago and New York have yet to call a truce for the sake of our taste buds. At least, that sounds about right. We’re also pretty proud to be home to all locations of </span><a href="http://www.pizzeriabianco.com/welcome"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pizzeria Bianco</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, owned by </span><a href="https://www.eater.com/2015/3/10/8155543/pizzeria-bianco-best-pizza-america"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the nation’s best pizza maker</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><b>We have REALLY good Mexican food, too.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Living near Mexico has its tortilla-wrapped, salsa-smothered, spice-infused perks. Unfortunately, we become burrito snobs when we visit other states, but it’s all worth it when you can live and work right by places like </span><a href="http://www.phxburritohouse.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PHX Burrito House</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and find ultimately authentic places like </span><a href="http://www.tacarbon.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ta Carbon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><em>Guest blog by Michael Zimmerlich of 80/20 Records</em></p>
<p>2018 is a big year for me as it marks 10 years since 80/20 Records was formed.  It’s incredible to think how far I’ve come and yet still how much I have to learn.  But I’ve certainly learned a lot since I’ve started.  As I look back, here are some revelations about staying in business for 10 years.</p>
<h4>Be adaptive</h4>
<p>80/20 Records functions very differently now than it did 10 years ago, or even a year ago.  It’s a constant change of discovering what is working and, more importantly, what isn’t working.</p>
<p>During the first year, I decided to offer management services to one of my artists that extended what I did for them on the record label, which turned into a nightmare.  Last year, I re-thought on how I could provide this to artists and launched a management arm of 80/20 Records, which so far has been very successful on many levels.</p>
<p>For eight years, my company was a side-hustle and I had a full-time job.  When I quit my day job to focus on my company, I moved in with my parents and cut my personal expenses.  I’ve also looked into other ways I could make money on the side that wasn’t as demanding on my time, such as crowdfunding consulting, ghostwriting, creating one-page website templates for artists and more.  Now, I’m focused on building management while maintaining the record label.</p>
<p>If I didn’t adapt to how the music industry was changing, as well as how my personal life was changing, I would’ve shut the doors of 80/20 Records a long time ago.</p>
<h4>You can’t do it alone</h4>
<p>Everyone needs help and I’m certainly no exception.  I’m a co-founder of 80/20 Records, and my partner at the time had a big part on the philosophies of the company we created together that are still a part of the label today.  In fact, my brother was a partner for a while, as well.  He brought infrastructure to the company that I never had before that I still use today.</p>
<p>Every artist I ever represented took a risk on me and my company, which wouldn’t exist without them.  I’ve had 16 interns that contributed in countless ways, everything from taking care of merchandise at shows to social media.  Not to mention all of my colleagues that I’ve met over the years that opened opportunities to me, provided incredible advice, or offered their friendship.  I’m extremely grateful for every single person that has helped me over the past 10 years.</p>
<h4>Be kind to everyone</h4>
<p>Cannot stress this enough.  There is no question in my mind that the reason I’m still in business after 10 years is how I treat others.  Anyone from the artists to my interns to my fellow colleagues, I try as hard as I can to treat them with respect and friendliness.  I make sure to show my gratitude for those who helped me and to pay it forward as often as I can to others.  This is a long-term investment into yourself and your community.</p>
<p>I’ve had falling outs with some of my artists, but I kept it professional and kept in touch with many of them.  In fact, one of my first artists contacted me after three years and apologized on how they handled things.  Most of my business comes from referrals from previous clients, artists and colleagues, who obviously wouldn’t have recommended me if I didn’t do my job and treat them well.  Your community is much smaller than you think and word gets around, both good and bad.</p>
<h4>It’s better to try and fail than not to try at all</h4>
<p>Before I started 80/20 Records, I never worked in the music industry.  I never did an internship with a music business company.  I never took a single music business class.  Instead, I bought two books: one on music business law and the other on record label marketing.  From the record label marketing book, I took note of what I could do, what I couldn’t do and what I thought was just stupid so was going to do something else.  I wanted to run a record label the way I thought it would be run.</p>
<p>My very first artist was a friend of mine that made electronic music.  I found a sample contract in the record label marketing book that I had him sign.  Then did a Google search on how to get your music on iTunes.  This is how I started 80/20 Records, I just…did it.</p>
<p>Things will never ever be perfect.  There will always be something that can be improved upon, but if you wait, you’ll never release anything.  I’ve had artist sign contracts that could’ve been clearer, hosted events that could’ve been planned better, launched marketing campaigns that could’ve been executed better.  But if I didn’t act, it would’ve taken so much longer to do these things.  As a result, I failed a lot.  I’ve lost money on events, lost artists cause I could’ve handled situations better, opportunities that slipped through my fingers.  But none of that would’ve happened if I didn’t just go for it and see what happens.  Life is too short to wonder what if this goes wrong.</p>
<h4>In conclusion</h4>
<p>Probably most important of all is to love what you’re doing.  It’s going to be a pain at times, chances are you’ll probably get stressed out or depressed, but in the end if you endure the bad times to appreciate the good times, then you know you have something worth fighting for.  I like to put it &#8220;if you don’t mind the ‘BS,’ then you know you found your place.&#8221; I love every single minute of what I do.  And I look forward to the next 10 years.</p>

<p>80/20 Records is an independent record label and management company based in Phoenix, AZ.</p>
<p>With over 10 years of experience in the music industry, Mike has been involved with 15 album releases, as well as several music videos. The artists he’s personally represented have opened for acts such as George Clinton and the Parliament Funkadelic, The Mighty Mighty Bosstones, Twenty One Pilots, Catfish and the Bottlemen, Maroon 5, Capital Cities, Phantogram, MR MS, Animal Collective and Beck.</p>
<p>To help raise funds to record albums for artists on 80/20 Records led him into crowdfunding. He successfully raised over $10,000 for his first campaign.  Since then, he’s helped several campaigns successfully reach their goal amounts and now advise others to achieve the same. To date, the campaigns Mike has assisted with raised over $130,000. <!--codes_iframe--></p></div>

As he takes his proactive steps to ruling the world, we&#8217;re excited to give him hands-on experience with all that goes into building a business. In the words of Connor Waslo (please read in an stellar Australian accent), &#8220;CO+HOOTS has all of that!&#8221; And now we have him to teach us how to wiggle our ears.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>Get our nintern&#8217;s two cents on life before they&#8217;re worth one Bitcoin:</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><b>Hometown: </b>Phoenix, AZ</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><b>Why did you want to work at CO+HOOTS? </b></div>
<div><b> </b>I work best surrounded by social people and lively environments. CO+HOOTS has all of that! As I work on my own startup, I&#8217;ll take any opportunity I can to learn how businesses run and to meet people living my dream. Interning here is basically the perfect opportunity for me to move towards accomplishing all sorts of goals.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><b>What are your hopes and dreams at CO+HOOTS? </b></div>
<div>Fame, fortune, a team of my own interns. Just kidding. I want to meet as many people as I can and absorb as much advice as possible. Capitalizing on such a great learning experience is the ultimate goal.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><b>Members in CO+HOOTS may be able to help you as well… What are your own personal hopes and dreams?</b></div>
<div>I hope to run my own successful startup. Ideally, once I&#8217;ve found my unicorn, I can help other people run their startups as efficiently as possible. Entrepreneurship is such a fantastic skill and someday I want to help kids realize that they don&#8217;t have to work for anybody. They can work for themselves.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><b>If you had 100 billion dollars, you would… </b></div>
<div><b> </b>Invest in education and environmental preservation.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><b>What should the CO+HOOTS community know about you? </b></div>
<div>I love meeting with new people and picking their brain about business, programming, life or anything! I appreciate all sorts of perspectives and would love to meet all of you.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><b>What is one thing people don’t know about you? </b></div>
<div>I&#8217;m not Australian or Russian but I can talk in some pretty decent Australian and Russian accents.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><b>Why are you so awesome? </b></div>
<div>I can wiggle my ears. Hands free. Basically a super power, y&#8217;know? I got offered to be a member of the Avengers but it didn&#8217;t quite fit in my schedule so I had to turn them down.</div>

Whereas microwave meals and fast food once saw their heyday in the office, and campfires were all the craze among busy Neanderthals, modern entrepreneur meals are bringing creative phrases to coworking spaces before the words even hit the dictionary:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I had work during Friendsgiving, but my coworker got turducken on Grubhub.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Just used UberEATS to order a gluten-free nitro cold brew straight to my desk.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Did you know Postmates delivers poke bowls and venti Frappuccinos?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As innovators who #GSD, we at CO+HOOTS love seeing tech meet food, almost as much as we love having food meet our taste buds. But sometimes, it’s an experience and affordability you’re after — not convenience and delivery fees. Here’s a list of some of our go-to local spots near CO+HOOTS to ensure deliciousness is accessible to you any time:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Breakfast/Brunch</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Breakfast is the most important meal of the day, but if you miss it, you’re in luck. </span><b><a href="http://goclarendon.com/restaurant/">Café Tranquilo</a> (0.5 mi)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is within walking distance and </span><b><a href="http://famephx.com/">fàme caffe</a> (1.2 mi)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a short bike ride away, and both serve breakfast all day long. We recommend the chilaquiles — at both locations — for the unique versions of a classic Latin American dish.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The recently opened </span><b><a href="https://ellysrestaurants.com/">Elly’s Brunch &amp; Cafe</a> (1.4 mi) </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">is our newest crush. </span></p>
<h3><b>Lunch</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s no secret that Cohootians are pretty obsessed with </span><b><a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/plaza-cafe-and-grill-phoenix">Plaza Cafe &amp; Grill</a> (0.3 mi)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We hold biweekly walks to lunch there. We cater from them. And we always know they have a bit of literally everything for everyone — even if you’re craving teriyaki bowls, quesadillas and mozzarella sticks all at once.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re looking for more of an adventure, bike over to </span><b><a href="http://zookzsandwiches.com/">Gadzooks</a> (0.7 mi)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or head to </span><b><a href="http://zookzsandwiches.com/">Zookz</a> (1.4 mi)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a couple light rail stops north. They have similar names, but you’ll never forget the magnificence of the former’s custom enchiladas or the beauty of the latter’s round sandwiches.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s also </span><b><a href="http://www.phxburritohouse.com/">Phoenix Burrito House</a> (1.1 mi)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which for burrito lovers is a place of worship. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Coffee Break</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you love social enterprises like us, </span><b><a href="http://therefugeaz.com/">The Refuge Cafe</a> (1.7 mi)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is for you. A bikeable distance away, it supports local charities with every cup of coffee you purchase! We also love bettering the environment by grabbing a good Black and White from </span><b><a href="http://www.luxcoffee.com/">Lux Central</a> (0.8 mi)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which is accessible on foot, bike and the light rail — no need to drive. Lux is always open until midnight or later, but when you need to pull through a true all-nighter, </span><b><a href="https://urbanbeans.com/">Urban Beans</a> (0.6 mi) </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">is open 24/7 with the best all-vegan toasted marshmallow lattes around.</span></p>

<h3><b>Dinner</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Macayo’s used to be right next to us. Now, </span><b><a href="http://www.macayo.com/">Woody’s Macayo</a> (0.2 mi)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is still basically right next to us. Did you know we ate 789 mini chimis in a year once? You could say we’re pretty satisfied — even though we’re always saving room to have chocolate chimis for dessert.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pho is just as close to Cohootian hearts. It was the center of our second longest general Slack discussion of 2017, which has crowned </span><b><a href="http://thuphonoodles.com/">Pho Noodles</a> (0.7 mi) </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">as the undisputed champion of local pho. Looking for the Italian kind of noodle? Take the light rail to Central and Camelback to head into </span><b><a href="http://www.saucepizzaandwine.com/">Sauce Pizza &amp; Wine</a> (1.4 mi)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">always</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> get the All Natural Strawberry-Basil Lemonade.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And there’s no way we can go to </span><b><a href="http://www.ocotillophx.com/">Ocotillo</a> (0.5 mi)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which also has a coffee bar open in the mornings, TOO many times. Once you go there, you’ll never want to leave. The only time we do is when they close. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Dessert</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our sweet tooth is never too far from us. You can easily bike from CO+HOOTS to two of our favorite shops with no time wasted. </span><b><a href="http://churnaz.com/">Churn</a> (1.6 mi)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> offers fresh ice cream selections — order the S’mores Sundae to bring the blowtorch out — while </span><b><a href="http://tsoynami.com/">Nami</a> (1.8 mi)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> offers delectable vegan pastries and tSoynami soft serve.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Bar</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the end of a long day, we all know you deserve a drink. You don’t need to travel too far. </span><b><a href="https://www.thecleverkoi.com/">The Clever Koi</a> (0.6 mi) </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">is more than a ramen haven, as it offers drinks that range from craft cocktails and wine to beer and sake. For a wider selection of beers, we suggest </span><b><a href="http://www.hussbrewing.com/">Huss Brewing Company’s Uptown Phoenix Taproom</a> (1.5 mi)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, where the famous Koffee Kölsch is just two light rail stops up. If you’re in the mood for wine, you can bike or light rail to </span><b><a href="http://ovenandvine.com/">Oven+Vine</a> (1.6 mi)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, where happy hour goes from open to 6 p.m. Then there’s </span><b><a href="https://www.changinghands.com/firstdraftbar">First Draft Book Bar</a> (1.5 mi)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Beer + Wine + Books? Heaven. </span></p>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p>Amaya Lim is a tech-savvy musician who dreams of funding problem-solving technologies and pursuing a creative future. Meanwhile, you may find her playing DJ while taking a walk on our treadmill desk. We love young entrepreneurs with initiative, and Amaya takes initiative to a whole new level (she&#8217;s in high school and interning with our member <a href="http://distillmill.com">Distill Mill</a> too!). Get to know our nintern before she&#8217;s famous:</p>
<p><strong>Hometown:</strong> Phoenix, Arizona</p>
<p><strong>Why did you want to work at CO+HOOTS?</strong><br /> I know that my personal productivity and creativity are deeply influenced by my environment; the quality of my work is a direct reflection of how stimulating my surroundings are. CO+HOOTS really checks all the boxes for an ideal workspace: strong culture of collaboration, focus on innovation and using technology to improve the world, and, of course, treadmill desks.</p>
<p><strong>What are your hopes and dreams at CO+HOOTS?</strong><br /> I would like to meet as many members as possible and gain a broad understanding of how they each run their businesses. There is no better way to gain entrepreneurial skills than actually being an entrepreneur, and as a student this opportunity is the next best thing. CO+HOOTS is integrating community outreach into an inventive business model, and I am inspired by that focus on the lasting impact a company can have on its environment.</p>
<p><strong>Members in CO+HOOTS may be able to help you as well… What are your own personal hopes and dreams? </strong><br /> As a high school senior, my most immediate goal is to graduate and attend university in the fall of 2018. Right now I’m hoping to be a computer science major and use those skills in the business world. I am also a musician, so I would hope to continue to pursue music and have a career that allows me to incorporate creativity into every day.</p>
<p><strong>If you had 100 billion dollars, you would…</strong><br /> I would first put away enough money for a college education! Then I would probably use the rest to invest in technologies or ideas that might solve some of the world’s biggest problems, but lack funding. For instance, some elite science fair projects actually have the power to make clean water or produce clean energy, and with a billion dollars I could help to bring those innovations to the communities that need them most.</p>
<p><strong>What should the CO+HOOTS community know about you? </strong><br /> I like learning new things about people—their work, background, interests, passions, favorite kind of cookie. I have this pretty intense resting face that looks a little angry, and it’s something that I’m working on, but know that in the meanwhile it is not a reflection of my disposition, which is actually quite sunny! Also, there’s a good chance I like the music that you listen to, and would love to hear any and all recommendations.</p>
<p><strong>What is one thing people don’t know about you? </strong><br /> I love making playlists, and I can DJ any mood at any time. Give me the aux cord and I will give you a party.</p>
<p><strong>Why are you so awesome?</strong><br /> I really am quite excited about working at CO+HOOTS, which I hope translates into my interactions with members. I’m really interested in all aspects of the space and its operations, and I will do my best to learn as much as I can through this incredible opportunity. <!--codes_iframe--></p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><span>A world where we can order five (or ten) pizzas before phone companies answer phone calls is a world where we have 50 pounds of new problems and absolutely no solutions. Here’s the good news: there’s one phone company out there that doesn’t suck.</span></p>
<p><span>Simple Phone Company is the only phone provider that offers actual human contact in 15 seconds or less. Once a little garage project, the California-based company is now a fully managed voice provider that creates solutions for all things communication: desk phones, apps, computers and more. It’s safe to say that the “Who Sucks the Least” era has ended, giving way to the customer-first generation.</span></p>
<p><span>Perhaps what’s most unique about Simple Phone Company is how strongly it delivers in its promise of personalized support for teams of any size.</span></p>
<p><span>It all starts with personal phone setup. Before a phone even leaves the warehouse, Simple Phone Company has it fully programmed — ready to work straight out of the box — and personalized straight down to the smallest of details.</span></p>
<p><span>“We take the time to put a label outside the box,” said Chris Meadows, the founder of Simple Phone Company. “Our warehouse guys are trained in good handwriting and they will write your name on the outside with your extension.”</span></p>
<p><span>At the heart of this approach is a people-over-profit attitude. Simple Phone Company allows customers to enjoy their experience so much that they forget office phone processes were once a pain. This leads to the next element in their approach: personal training.</span></p>
<p><span>As phones arrive, team members — like our beloved Cohootians Tim Desmarais and Cody Grimes — schedule 30 minutes to help customers learn how to use their phones with guidance and humor.</span></p>
<p><span>“We’re able to speak your language on your level,” Chris said. “If one training’s not enough, we’ll schedule another one. We make it so that we’re always available to you.”</span></p>
<p><span>Simple Phone Company’s unique services can appeal to virtually any business, from coffee shop entrepreneurs to Fortune 500 companies. In a recent example, the company was able to connect thousands of locations for a global fast food chain under one service. This didn’t just cut costs — it allowed international locations and corporate headquarters to communicate directly.</span></p>
<p><span>Growing by thousands of users per month — without ever going into debt, crowdfunding or using traditional marketing — Simple Phone Company is a startup success that has called CO+HOOTS a part of its equation for over a year. Chris said having an office in the coworking space provides a vibrant community that his business can help and leverage.</span></p>
<p><span>“When we need help with something that is specific to a different vertical or industry, we know that there’s such a diverse amount of people with different experiences within the CO+HOOTS community, we can reach out to say, ‘Does anyone have experience with this?’” Chris said. “Almost always, someone says yes.”</span></p>
<p><span>In Simple Phone Company, the community is naturally where every employee’s heart is. It’s a place to call home.</span></p>
<p><span>“I get to follow the dream with a team that also shares that same mission,” Chris said. “Every day, we get to come to work and do something that we love. We get to work with people around the world. We get to work with partners all over the place and we get to do that within a community that we love. Very few people get that opportunity.”</span> <!--codes_iframe--></p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p>Working with 700 people from around the world means that Stephen’s team isn’t built on the foundation of one person’s experience. It’s built on the foundation of 700. Which foundation sounds sturdier?</p>
<p><strong>The future of the workforce is going to consist of happier workers that are location independent and aren’t hindered by their socioeconomic status, gender or race.</strong></p>
<p>Companies will enjoy the benefits reaped when workers aren’t forced to show up to an uninspiring cubicle-laden dungeon with barely any windows after sitting in hours of traffic. They’ll see more innovation by hopping on a Zoom call for a team meeting and seeing the variety of faces on the screen, all with new experiences and ideas from their varying locations of the world.</p>
<p>Companies comprised of an inclusive and diverse workforce that supports happy workers is the future of work we all deserve.</p>
