				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone’s desk setup is a little different. Some people are total minimalists, while others claim to know where everything is. While your workstation should always be yours to make your own, following great desk setup strategies can also help your productivity grow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you have a </span><a href="https://cohoots.com/locations/phoenix/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">dedicated desk</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a coworking space or a dedicated workstation at home, your surroundings impact your efficiency. This includes everything from where your work tools are placed to how far your monitor is from your face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To help you create a blueprint for your workstation, we asked our founder Jenny Poon to provide some </span><a href="https://cohoots.com/2018/03/19/our-desk-spirations/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">inspiration for your desk setup</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We’ll also explain three setup tips you can draw from her example and provide three more ideas you can easily implement.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jenny’s desk setup</span></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our founder is a self-proclaimed efficiency nut and if you’ve ever seen her getting sh*t done, you know she’s doing something right. Here’s what she has to say about her desk setup:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My desk is a super important part of my efficiency process. I make sure I have Post-its and a notepad handy, as I always take notes. I have found having a desk that has drawers has been a godsend for keeping my desk tidy and clean, but with easy access to the necessities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have a larger monitor and run off of a laptop, so I can be mobile when I need to, but when designing or working on spreadsheets, I can project up. I found out I could also connect my iPad as an extension to my screen and that has been super helpful, as I just keep my Slack on there so I can always be available via chat for my now-remote team.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why her desk setup works</span></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So how does this desk setup boost productivity? Let’s dissect the three main ergonomic strategies that Jenny uses and how you can implement them, too.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Most-used items are kept within arm’s reach.</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When organizing your desk, your most important tools should always be placed closest to your seat or standing mat. If you love jotting down notes like Jenny, keeping your pen and paper nearby will allow you to grab it in an instant, without shifting away from your primary task.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bonus points: If you keep these heavily used items in designated spots, you naturally create a physical workflow for yourself.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Cleanliness is prioritized.</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if you know where everything is, a messy desk can hinder your productivity. By keeping least-used items and knick-knacks stored away, Jenny’s desk setup minimizes distractions and allows her to efficiently navigate her workspace.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A clean desk can also feel more inviting, whereas clutter can add to your stress. In addition to investing in drawers (if your desk doesn’t include any), you may consider purchasing basic accessories like </span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/OHill-Organizer-Management-Organizing-Adhesive/dp/B071FXZBMV/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cable clips</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Simple-Trending-Supplies-Organizer-Vertical/dp/B07SNBHQ28/ref=sr_1_7?crid=31GORS15ZFSN0&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=desk+organizers&amp;qid=1591278662&amp;sprefix=desk+organ%2Caps%2C246&amp;sr=8-7"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tiered desk organizers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. It’s customized for her work habits.</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone works differently, but Jenny is always on-the-go. By using her laptop as a primary device and casting her other tech in purposeful, supporting roles, she can easily unplug, pack up and head to wherever she needs to be.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alternatively, if you’re typically stationary throughout your workday, you can make a desktop computer the star of the show to avoid switching between devices.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">3 more desk setup ideas for productivity</span></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As our founder’s example has shown, the most efficient workstations are always neat and purposeful. Here are some extra desk setup tips that you can implement to drive your productivity further along:</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Support your natural posture</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keeping an upright posture can enhance your focus, while warding off common health problems for office workers like bad backs and carpal tunnel — which, of course, can cause highly distracting aches and pains. Your desk setup can actually encourage you to sit properly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To promote good posture:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Keep your monitor at eye level.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Whether you’re sitting down or using a standing desk, your monitor should help you face forward without a hunched back, and be close enough so you’re not craning your neck.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Choose the right chair.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> An ergonomic chair can encourage you to keep your spine straight and supported. When setting it up, make sure it’s at a level that keeps your feet flat, while allowing you to reach straight for your keyboard without bent wrists.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Increase natural light</span></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.inc.com/cameron-albert-deitch/office-design-productivity-success-capital-one-study.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Natural light is key</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for greater productivity and better mental health. Positioning your desk close to a window will help you boost your happiness and your focus all at once. Natural light helps you take advantage of your circadian rhythm and stay awake, even without the coffee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Live in a box? Daylight bulbs that keep you energized are recommended.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Choose your decor wisely</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While most unnecessary items should be kept off your desk, keeping a small amount of decor can boost your mood while you’re working. Choose a few items that you love, but doesn’t take up a lot of space, such as a family photo.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Small plants are always a good option, as the presence of greenery can lead to </span><a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/office-plants-boost-productivity#:~:text=Plants%20can%20add%20more%20to,up%20to%2015%20per%20cent.&amp;text=%22Plants%20aren't%20used%20to,very%20fast%2Dvarying%20environments.%22"><span style="font-weight: 400;">15% more productivity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just make sure your decor isn’t in the way when you’re reaching for essential items.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create your happy place</span></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you have a great desk setup that’s customized for you, your workspace can be your productive place </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> your happy place. There aren’t actually any rules when it comes to designing your desk, but when you use our ergonomic strategies, you will feel your efficiency grow.</span></p>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Businesses everywhere are waking up to a need for diversity and inclusivity in the workplace. If you haven’t already, now is absolutely the time to invest in inclusion to drive measurable results — and for the greater good, of course.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://cohoots.com/about/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our team</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is focused on bringing diverse entrepreneurs together, because we know a culture of inclusion can lift up an entire community. In the same vein, creating a team filled with unique individuals whose opinions are equally valued can make a world of difference within your organization.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But why exactly are diversity and inclusion worth the effort? And how can you make it happen? We’re here to help you get the answers you need.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is diversity in the workplace exactly?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Workplace diversity occurs when employees at each level of your organization can be distinguished through their unique perspectives and experiences.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diversity can take many forms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your team may consist of people of different genders, races, sexual orientations, education levels, physical abilities and ages — all of which impact their personal experiences.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Professional diversity is important, too. Even within the same department, a diverse team will have a wide variety of skill sets and ways of thinking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re worried about accidentally hiring mortal enemies, do not fear. A commitment to diversity doesn’t mean you need to look for polar opposites. No matter how different your team members are, they should all feel connected by the same core values. This overarching unity will enable your business to benefit from the positive impact of diversity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Benefits of diversity at work</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diversity in the workplace isn’t just a fad. Business leaders stand behind it because it leads to greater efficiency and longevity. We’ll list out a few ways you can directly benefit from encouraging diversity at work, but we promise this is just the start of a million reasons why inclusion matters.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. It enhances your decision-making.</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you bring together people with unique knowledge and perspectives, you will naturally have a team that can tackle challenges from every angle. As you bounce ideas off one another, you’ll develop more creative solutions, twice as fast — and the decisions you make will be </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/company/stories/new-research-diversity-inclusion-better-decision-making-work/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">better 87% of the time</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diversity is also the key to weeding out tone-deaf marketing before it’s blasted out. When your team actually represents the diverse makeup of the greater community, you eliminate your blind spots and stay hyper-aware about how your audience may perceive your message.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. It boosts your profits.</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you invest in workplace diversity, you get returns. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just looking at gender diversity, having a more balanced mix of men and </span><a href="https://cohoots.com/2019/03/26/lessons-from-women-in-leadership/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">women in leadership</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can actually increase the likelihood of above-average profits </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/karstenstrauss/2018/01/25/more-evidence-that-company-diversity-leads-to-better-profits/#1853b0991bc7"><span style="font-weight: 400;">by 21%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diversity is also </span><a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/346229"><span style="font-weight: 400;">known to attract</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> top talent, investors and customers, so if your dedication to building a diverse team doesn’t create immediate results, it will boost and continue to boost your ROI soon enough.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. It keeps your employees engaged.</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No one wants to work for a team where they don’t feel included. Diversity is directly linked to </span><a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/au/en/pages/human-capital/articles/role-diversity-practices-inclusion-trust-employee-engagement.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">higher levels of trust</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which ultimately leads to employee engagement — a huge factor in organizational productivity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pairing diversity with a strong culture of inclusion will further help your team members feel valued and heard. Because they feel comfortable with and connected to the broader team, they’re also less likely to leave. With employee retention rates high, you won’t have to eat the </span><a href="https://www.hrdive.com/news/study-turnover-costs-employers-15000-per-worker/449142/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">extremely high cost</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of employee turnover.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to build a culture of inclusivity</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building an inclusive team is an active process that requires you to do more than stick diverse people together. Here are some tips on how you can promote and nurture a healthy, inclusive culture as you build your diverse team:</span></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Encourage collaboration.<span style="font-weight: 400;"> When your employees are working in silos, this can hinder your progress. Find ways for your team members to work together, so they can learn from each other and build off of each other’s ideas.</span></b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Offer diversity training.<span style="font-weight: 400;"> Even if you’re confident that all your team members value diversity, almost everyone has implicit biases that they need to overcome. Training can help your employees grow, while building trust and acceptance.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Support professional development.<span style="font-weight: 400;"> Once you achieve strong diversity, you need to continue engaging employees by helping them advance in their careers. This could be achieved through mentorship, a professional development stipend or a similar initiative.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Again, remember that diversity in the workplace only occurs when there’s diversity at every level. Your leadership team must reflect your commitment to inclusion, or else your efforts will be drowned by an echo chamber of decision-makers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<h3>Make diversity an ongoing commitment</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diversity isn’t created in one day, nor does inclusion continue if you fail to nurture it. Making diversity and inclusion core values in your business will help you outperform your competitors, while keeping your team fully satisfied.</span></p>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social media isn’t all cats, memes, cat memes and millennials. It’s also a massive digital community where all of your potential leads, </span><a href="https://cohoots.com/advisors/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">advisors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, investors and collaborators may be just a message away. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you prioritize social networking for business, in addition to building relationships at your </span><a href="https://cohoots.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">local coworking space</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you create more connections that guarantee your long-term growth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This article will give you clear guidance on why social networking matters and how you can use it to gain the competitive advantage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why social networking matters</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As social media increasingly becomes a digital </span><a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2016/09/14/third-places-as-community-builders/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">third place</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, its power has become impossible to ignore. Online interactions are no longer a separate world — they’re directly influencing real-life connections, both personal and professional.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, </span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2016/06/22/social-media-and-the-workplace/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">less than a quarter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of professionals are creating or strengthening business relationships through social media. This huge gap represents your opportunity to take the lead.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With </span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/fact-sheet/social-media/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">over 70% of all U.S. adults</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> maintaining at least one social media profile — and the number only rising as younger generations enter adulthood and the workforce — the time is now to use this digital space for professional networking.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">5 social networking tips for business leaders</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As is the case when you do anything in business, you don’t want to leave strategy behind when you start leveraging social media for your career growth. Use these five tips when social networking for business to maximize your time and ensure your efforts don’t go to waste:</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Build your brand first</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you’re reaching out to and engaging with other users and businesses on social media, they should get a clear picture of who you are upon visiting your page. Make sure everything from your bio to your content matches who you want to be perceived as professionally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The more consistent you are across all platforms — this may include using the same handle, using matching profile pictures and posting with the same frequency — the stronger your brand will be.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Online attention spans are extremely short, so it’s important that visitors can recognize what you do and remember who you are after a quick skim of your profile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re an established entrepreneur and want to further enhance your brand on social media, you may consider </span><a href="https://www.thebalancesmb.com/how-to-develop-your-brand-strategy-2295187"><span style="font-weight: 400;">developing a brand strategy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for yourself. This will help you define who you are, communicate your message clearly and speak to the right audience. Your strategy will also help you create guidelines for your voice and visuals.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Prioritize the right channels</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not every channel is equally suited for professional networking in your specific industry. Just because LinkedIn is designed to help anyone network doesn’t mean your specific audience is there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have a game plan for what types of professionals you want to reach out to — list out specific people if you have anyone in mind — and figure out what platforms they’re using. Use advanced search tools on LinkedIn, Facebook and Twitter to narrow down your searches faster.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, keep in mind that just because someone’s on a channel doesn’t mean it’s the right place to network with them. If someone is clearly using their Instagram page just to post dog and baby pictures, they’re probably not looking for professional connections on the app.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Join professional groups</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facebook Groups can be your go-to resource when you want to make new virtual connections, need support or give back to your peers. These virtual groups are mini communities of their own that instantly give you something in common with other members.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To find some local business groups or worldwide industry-based groups, search by keywords like “Arizona business” or “marketing” and join (or request to join) groups that sound interesting and helpful. You can always leave if they turn out to be poorly moderated, with too much spam or too many distractions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though not as plentiful, you can also search for groups on LinkedIn for more formal networking.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Personalize your pitch</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On social media, where authenticity rules, others can see right through you if you’re not genuine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A first rule of thumb is to never directly copy, paste and send your messages to every single person you reach out to. Whether you’re reaching out on LinkedIn, Twitter, or somewhere else, your recipient is unlikely to respond if you don’t show why you’re reaching out to them specifically.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your pitch should also be unique from any email-based pitches you send out. Even when you’re social networking for business, social media tends to be a more personable platform where your “best regards” probably aren’t the best way to close out a message.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">5. Offer value first</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People don’t buy products and services. They buy the value the products and services provide.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similarly, your pitch will be most effective if you create value before you try to sell. While salesy messages can easily be ignored, messages that offer a </span><a href="https://cohoots.com/speaker-series/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">helpful resource</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a free trial or even a call to simply connect will usually get you at least one response.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lasting professional relationships — which are more valuable than one-time sales — can only begin if there’s mutual benefit and a human connection.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Master virtual networking</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social media makes it possible for professionals to connect anytime, from just about anywhere. Even if you live in the middle of nowhere or there are no networking events in your area, there’s no excuse not to start social networking for business — as long as you have WiFi, that is.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you’ve built up your virtual network, you may start planning some in-person collaborations soon. When you’re ready to take your professional relationships offline, </span><a href="https://cohoots.com/meeting-rooms-event-space/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">grab a meeting room in a creative space</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to inspire your strongest ideas.</span></p></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve ever looked up how to get smarter (haven’t we all?), reading more is probably on your to-do list. After all, some of the most successful people around make books a staple in their lives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just to name a few: Warren Buffett reads at least </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/27/warren-buffetts-key-tip-for-success-read-500-pages-a-day.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">500 pages per day</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Mark Cuban reads four to </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/31/what-mark-cuban-reads-every-day.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">five hours daily</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Oprah Winfrey and Reese Witherspoon both built massive followings from their monthly book clubs alone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But when your goal is to hone your entrepreneurial skills, how do you know what business books to read? Blindly picking “Twilight” off the shelf probably won’t help you much.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve put together a list of modern business book recommendations that you can put on your reading list to maximize your professional growth. Whether you’re a business owner, freelancer or just an entrepreneurial spirit, these picks can help you diversify your knowledge and apply it into your day-to-day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t worry — there’s no young adult fiction or $200 textbooks here.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why read business books?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Excellent reading habits may be a characteristic shared by many of the world’s top entrepreneurs, but correlation doesn’t imply causation, right? It makes sense to be a little skeptical when your time is on the line.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the positive effects of reading have been proven time and time again. Not only does it increase your vocabulary and make you seem like the most intelligent person on the block, but it </span><a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/what-does-reading-do-to-your-brain-these-5-effects-are-pretty-astounding-74676"><span style="font-weight: 400;">boosts your memory</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and learning capacity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you’re reading about business specifically, you’re filling up that learning capacity with knowledge that really matters. This knowledge can then be applied directly into your operations, strategies and much more.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Three best business books for strategy-building</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The heart of your company is business strategy. When you’re building your master plan, you need to take as much of the guesswork out of the equation as possible. These three books will do the trick:</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. “Traction: Get a Grip on Your Business”</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Traction: Get a Grip on Your Business” by Gino Wickman is one of </span><a href="https://cohoots.com/about/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">our founders</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">’ go-to guides for making decisions or evaluating any approach.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This business book offers a practical system for strengthening the most important parts of your organization, including your vision, data and team. The result is greater efficiency and less stress.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best part is, the book is interactive, so you’ll have actual action items to take away.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Traction-Get-Grip-Your-Business/dp/1936661837"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get the book here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. “The End of Competitive Advantage: How to Keep Your Strategy Moving as Fast as Your Business”</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Written by strategy expert Rita Gunther McGrath, this is the business book to read if you want to make sure your approach is fit for the modern world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The End of Competitive Advantage” acknowledges that change is happening quicker than ever — in every industry — and teaches you how to be quick on your feet. Instead of giving you one surefire path, this book will get you an evergreen mindset that will help you constantly adapt your business strategy.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/End-Competitive-Advantage-Strategy-Business/dp/1422172813"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get the book here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. “The Startup Handbook: Your Step-By-Step, Straight-Talking Guide To Building A Great Business In Your Life”</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many startups don’t make it past their first year. Even if you’ve joined a coworking space — which can make you </span><a href="https://www.business.com/articles/5-things-to-consider-when-looking-for-a-coworking-space/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">four times more likely to succeed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — you’ll encounter many hurdles as you go. But Morris Grant knows that all hurdles can be overcome with a solid business plan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In “The Startup Handbook,” Grant walks you through realistic business tips, ways to stay motivated and many mistakes that you can easily avoid.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Startup-Handbook-Step-Step-Straight-Talking-ebook/dp/B01FWDFV44"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get the book here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two best business books for people management</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A business can’t run itself — it needs people. But you and your team can only be at your best if you can continue to stay motivated and grow together. These are the two business books to read when you want to maximize your team’s every effort:</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. “Radical Candor: Be a Kick-Ass Boss Without Losing Your Humanity”</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Far too many business book lists fail to include voices from </span><a href="https://cohoots.com/2019/03/26/lessons-from-women-in-leadership/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">women in leadership</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which is a shame because they’re all missing out on Kim Scott’s guide on being an empathetic leader.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Radical Candor” is all about building a culture of feedback that lifts your team up without knocking anyone down. This book will help you nurture your relationships within your organization, so you can move forward at the same pace.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Radical-Candor-Kim-Scott/dp/B01KTIEFEE"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get the book here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. “Managing Oneself: The Key to Success”</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes, it’s not managing other people you need to worry about — it’s managing yourself. Peter F. Drucker, who is known as the father of modern management, helps you stay accountable and lead by example.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Managing Oneself” is a short, practical guide for anyone who wants to become a better CEO for themselves or for their teams.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Managing-Oneself-Peter-F-Drucker/dp/163369304X"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get the book here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two best business books for boosting ROI</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So you have your overarching strategy down and your team running at max efficiency. The next step is making sure you understand how to stand out in your market to continuously profit more. These two business books can help:</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. “Blue Ocean Strategy: How to Create Uncontested Market Space and Make the Competition Irrelevant”</span></h2>

</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>REOPENING PLAN &#8211; STARTING MAY 18, 2020</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we think about what the future of our community looks like, CO+HOOTS is approaching our reopening focused on keeping all CO+HOOTIANS safe. While our community interactions may look a little different than before, we are taking the necessary steps to care for all of our collective wellbeing with you at the center of it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social distancing may be part of our new normal, but collaboration and connection remain more important than ever—and having a safe place to do that is essential. First and foremost, we want our community to feel safe enough to come in and work together and still feel comfortable being with friends and family outside of work. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s why we are working tirelessly to evaluate our space and prepare it for reopening. We are taking measures to ensure distancing measures and sanitization protocols are in place to protect all CO+HOOTians. But, we need your help too. The wellbeing of our community depends on all of us to do our part. </span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Our Space</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">We are making space and services updates to maintain hygiene safety and physical distancing best practices in three ways:</span></p>
<p><b style="font-size: 20px;">Prioritizing personal space:</b><span style="font-size: 20px;"> By modifying shared spaces with staggered seating and buffer zones, members can continue to operate while still maintaining a healthy physical distance from fellow members.</span></p>
<p><b>OUR ACTION: </b></p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have put down visual markers to designate 6’ distance</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have rearranged our open space to stagger seating, so please mind the signs and leave furniture in its place</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flex/Open spots have also been redesigned/redistributed to allow for safe work distance</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have opened up our classroom space as an overflow area, feel free to take your lunch or call in this space and sit in a designated spot</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Increased sanitization:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> We are disinfecting common areas more frequently and are providing sanitization products in our spaces.</span></p>
<p><b>OUR RESPONSE:</b></p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have brought on our favorite facility man, Pilo to come daily and disinfect all areas</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our team will wipe all high-touch surfaces daily as well</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have added hand sanitizer and alcohol wipes throughout the space, please wipe down any space after you use it</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have installed door openers that you can open with your foot on phone room doors, bathrooms and front door to minimize exposure to high touch points</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><b style="font-size: 20px;">Behavioral signage: </b><span style="font-size: 20px;">New cleaning standards and capacity protocols will be posted throughout the space as friendly reminders to members and staff to keep our space safe.</span><span style="font-size: 20px;"> </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Our People, Our Community</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Starting May 18, we are requiring that everyone must wear masks at CO+HOOTS.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wearing a mask is one of the most effective ways we can stop the spread in our communities. You can read more about that at the following link: </span><a href="https://bit.ly/whywearamask"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://bit.ly/whywearamask</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is a simple step we all can take to minimize our risk to one another. We wear masks to protect you, and we need you to wear a mask to protect us and the entire CO+HOOTS community. Moving forward, we are adopting a zero tolerance policy regarding masks. If you arrive without one, you will be asked to leave and return when properly equipped.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order for us to safely reopen, we must come together as a community and adopt these necessary measures to protect one another. We’re doing our best to set up the office with the needed supplies and create proper distancing in our shared spaces, but it won’t be effective unless you do your part too. That means wearing a mask, wiping down the areas you work in, respecting others&#8217; physical space, and not coming in if you don’t feel well.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The Plan</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are committed to protecting our staff and community members by taking a phased approach to reopening.

But to us, it is an entreprenerd&#8217;s canvas ready and waiting to be painted by your productive madness. </span></p>
<p><span>From tools to gimmicks to things that bring us efficiency and pleasure, the items we bring to work with us have some sort of purpose.  We call them our Desk-Spirations. They reveal a little bit about who we are and what drives our momentous spirits. </span></p>
<p><span>They keep the ball rolling. Plus, they look great. Go ahead and take a look! </span></p>
<h3><b>Desk-Spirations for Motivation </b></h3>
<h4></h4>
<h4><span>Family Photos </span></h4>
<p><span>What better way to revamp your motivation than to have those most important to you staring you right in the face? Of course, they are there to cheer you on. </span><span>“You got this!” “We support you!” “Feed me a treat when you get home!” (Don’t forget: For Cohootians, pets are family too.)</span></p>

<h4><span>Quotes</span></h4>
<p>Training your brain to think positive thoughts is an invaluable personal development skill. And here at CO+HOOTS, we are all about pushing past our limits. We love to have motivational quotes on our desk. Double points go to those who have them framed, hand-lettered and given to them as a gift from a friend.</p>

<h3><b>Desk+Spirations for Efficiency </b></h3>
<h4><span>Screen Space </span></h4>
<p><span>How many monitors does it take for you to get down to business? One? Two? Three? Four? Whatever the count is for you, our space is available to make it your own. Right now, the winning number in our office is three. But, who&#8217;s counting?  </span></p>
<h3><b>Desk+Spirations for a Hoot </b></h3>
<h4><span>Fun Mouse Pad </span></h4>
<p><span>Why so serious? Sometimes, in the midst of all our deadlines, we need those little reminders to relax, take it easy and have some fun. Mouse pads with dog-faced tacos will probably do the trick. It hits both marks on usability and fun! A win-win in our books.</span></p>
<h4><span>Music</span></h4>
<p><span>For us, music isn’t just the coffee shop tunes you hear in the background. (Don’t worry, we’ve got that too). </span><span>In our workspace, music can be seen as a Cohootian hanging his guitar on the wall right behind <a href="https://www.gearhungry.com/best-l-shaped-desk/">his desk</a>. Whatever it is that keeps you in tune. Go ahead and rock out to your own beat!</span></p>

<h4><span>Plants &amp; Rocks</span></h4>
<p><span>Cohootians love feeling close to nature. We LOVE it. You’ll see work spaces decorated with air plants, geologic rocks and orchids, and frequent flyers posted next to tall, open windows streaming in natural light.</span></p>
<p><img class="wp-image-14486 alignnone" src="https://cohoots.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/IMG_4778-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="448" height="299" /></p>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p>Over the past semester, I had the opportunity to intern at CO+HOOTS out of midtown Phoenix. I had never had an internship before with any company, let alone a company so unique, and I was eager for the next months ahead of me. What I gained from my experience was something I would have never expected, and something I would never trade.</p>
<h4>CO+mmunity</h4>
<p>I had never heard of anything like CO+HOOTS before, let alone had the chance to work in such a space. I was intrigued by the idea of coworking in a community that fostered collaboration. It seemed like a mouthful, but I was excited to see just what it meant. From my short time at CO+HOOTS, I was able to learn not only what it meant to be in a community, but also what it means to belong to a community. From brief conversations with members in the kitchen, to getting to know businesses and entrepreneurs within the work space, I learned that there is always someone willing to teach you something if you make the time to learn.</p>
<h4>CO+llaboration</h4>
<p>I have found in other jobs I previously had that not everyone was willing to work or listen to someone new to the workforce that had little relevant experience to offer; this was NOT the case when I came to CO+HOOTS. Immediately, my ideas and opinions were welcomed, and even taken into consideration on projects big and small. My skills were put to use in ways that I wouldn’t have thought of on my own. I was given the chance to collaborate alongside other interns, as well as industry professionals, with the skills and connections made from the networking given to me by CO+HOOTS.</p>
<h4>CO+work &amp; CO+care</h4>
<p>When I came to CO+HOOTS, I was pleasantly surprised by how comfortable I felt from my very first visit. I was welcomed by friendly faces and down-to-earth people that I could connect with on a business and personal level. As a typical college student, I have a lot on my plate and am pretty overwhelmed a majority of the time. When I was having a bad day (okay, bad week), I was able to go to my supervisors and express my frustrations with school, work and just life in general. It felt good knowing that I worked with people that actually cared about my well-being and how I was doing when I was outside the office, too.</p>
<p>From my time at CO+HOOTS, I learned an indescribable amount of life lessons about business, entrepreneurship, networking and what it means to have a friend. As my time at CO+HOOTS comes to a close, I can’t help but think of what fellow intern Bryce Manhardt likes to remind us of from The Lego Movie: “Everything is awesome when you’re part of a team.” Although my time with the team has come to a close, I know I’ll be able to call upon anyone of them whenever I need a helping hand. <!--codes_iframe--></p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><span>When choosing a career path, whether it be for the first time or fifth time, it can be overwhelming. Whether you are a recent college grad, high school senior or experienced industry professional, there can be so many directions to go, you may not know which way is up after a while. CO+HOOTS member Steven Rudolph said it best when he compared it to going to an ice cream shop: “There are too many choices. You don’t know which type of ice cream to choose.”</span></p>
<p><span>This is the very dilemma Steven set out to solve with his company <a href="http://www.multiplenatures.com/">Multiple Natures</a>. He said the aim of the company “is to help people identify their potential and to align it with the work that they do so they get greater fulfillment and success, life balance and direction.” It was after a journey practically around the world that Steven was able to not only discover his love of teaching, but also “(find in his) own evolution that (he is) good at finding other people,” as well.</span></p>
<p><span>His journey would begin with his undergraduate degree from the University of Florida, where he would then move to New York City in a hope to find “fame and fortune as a rockstar.” As all authentic rockstars start off, Steven got a job to help pay the bills, but what would happen next would ultimately change his career path altogether. This part-time job? Teaching. </span></p>
<p><span>“I fell in love… in my first classes and I thought, ‘How come nobody ever told me about teaching?’ I didn’t know I had this ability,” Steven said. </span></p>
<p><span>This would begin the trek across the world, which took Steven to Japan and then India, where he would create Jiva Public School. What started with eight children grew to more than 2,000 and over his 20 years spent in India, other schools picked it up. </span></p>
<p><span>“The core of the program is that every child has to do some introspection, figure out what their strengths are and make the decisions for their course of study,” Steven said.</span></p>
<p><span>Steven would then advance to Europe, taking on France, Switzerland and Lithuania. He created a program where “people were choosing the course and direction of their life based on who they were.” People everywhere have been choosing it for the different experience it brings, so much so that the website is offered in three languages: English, French and even Lithuanian. </span></p>
<p><span>He soon knew it was time to build it out. That’s when he decided it was time to move back to the U.S. and fully build Multiple Natures to scale.</span></p>
<p><span>Mentor and friend Francine Hardaway had been selling the city of Phoenix to Steven for years before the move back to the States, but was able to officially convince him after his first visit to CO+HOOTS. Steven said Francine told him, “Don’t even start thinking about apartments. The first thing you go do is you drive over to CO+HOOTS right now, and you meet Odeen and Jenny, and you get yourself a desk there. Then, once you’ve got your place, then you find an apartment and you’ll see everything will fall into place.”</span></p>
<p><span>Heeding her advice, Steven made the journey to midtown and realized CO+HOOTS is where he needed to be. </span></p>
<p><span>“It gave me a beautiful, energetic, focused environment that enabled me to feel instantly at home, with respect to my business and my work,” Steven said. “There was no friction here. When I sat at my desk, I felt energized by the other people who are around the community that’s here, which is very supportive. It gave me a grounding and insights into the entrepreneurial scene.”</span></p>
<p><span>Multiple Natures has been able to “create tools that are best in class…for working with clients in the process of identification and alignment of potential.” In this, the company has been able to help countless people in finding the right career path for them. Being a part of the CO+HOOTS community has provided Steven with the chance to not only help others in solving their own ice cream dilemmas, but serve as a valuable asset to the community and fellow entrepreneurs. </span> <!--codes_iframe--></p></div>

<p><span>Sampson isn’t just your average lovable brown-eyed boy — he’s legendary around the office for stealing hearts. If you have the opportunity to sit down with Sampson he would probably tell you “hav-hav” followed by a sniff, which is his polite way of asking for a belly rub. I was lucky enough to sit down with Sampson and ask him a few questions. </span></p>
<p><span>I started off by asking, “Are you a morning person or a night person?” He responded with a laugh and sneeze, reminding me he actually isn’t a person at all. I could feel his sense of humor melting my heart already. When I asked Sampson the most embarrassing thing that’s ever happened to him, he recalled the time he was playing fetch with <a href="http://thegreydesign.com">Grey Design</a> founder Ashley Marshall (his human) and he jumped up to catch a toy, but had the timing all wrong: “Bow wow ouch to say the least.”</span></p>
<p><span>Sampson and I decided to take a walk around the CO+HOOTS office. The more we walked around the more starstruck I felt. While being greeted and pet by his numerous fans, I asked Sampson if he could speak another language, what he would choose. He answered immediately with French. I asked him what made him pick the Language of Love so confidently, and he told me he wanted to flirt with all the belles of the office. Classic Sampson. I wrapped up my time with Sampson by asking him the timeless question, “Who’s a good boy?” We both knew, without question, it’s him.    </span></p>
<p><b><i><img class="size-medium wp-image-13435 alignleft" src="https://cohoots.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/21105438_1635842979790442_5192679524255840277_n-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" />Chloe:</i></b></p>
<p><span>If you’re looking to meet the queen of the CO+HOOTS office, look no further than Chloe, our favorite German Shepherd. On an average day, you can find Chloe hangin’ out with the gang at <a href="https://www.ackmanndickenson.com/">Ackmann &amp; Dickenson</a> and enjoying the air conditioning. If Chloe lets you give her a good pet, you won’t be disappointed; in fact, if you smell your hand afterwards, you’ll be pleasantly surprised. </span></p>
<p><span>I started by asking Chloe what the weirdest nickname she’s ever had was. She gave it some thought, but then told me it was “Stop Chewing That” and that she had no clue why she was called that. I could see there was more than meets the surface with Chloe and wondered what made her so special. I asked her if there was something she disliked with no good reason for disliking it. She gave me an “arf-arf,” which clearly meant Macadamia nuts, and I couldn’t agree more myself. </span></p>
<p><span>As it turns out, this wasn’t the only thing Chloe and I have in common. She is also a Virgo. I wondered just how seriously Chloe took her horoscope, and she told me she doesn&#8217;t even consider her day to have started until she checks it. I asked Chloe if she would be willing to share her favorite quote with the readers of CO+HOOTS,  she shared with me the following by Chris Rock: “Ruff-ruff *double pant, sniff, a big ole tail wag* ruuufff: ruf,” or loosely translated, “There are only three things women need in life: food, water and compliments.” If you get the opportunity to sit down with Chloe, I two paws up would recommend. </span></p>
<p><b><i><img class="size-medium wp-image-13438 alignright" src="https://cohoots.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Piper-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" />Piper:</i></b></p>
<p><span>Piper, aka Mr. Congeniality, is a lovable, huggable, ball of joy in the Wired PR office in CO+HOOTS. If you don’t catch Piper around the office, there’s a good chance he’s at CrossFit or doing an Agility workout, which he would recommend highly. I got the chance to sit down with Piper and I quickly learned why he is one of the most popular dogs in the office. </span></p>
<p><span>His secretary and owner Beth Cochran, co-founder of <a href="https://wiredprgroup.com/">Wired PR</a>, was able to squeeze me into his busy schedule and in return, I gave him a good back rub. The first thing I noticed were his impeccable muscles and how loose they are. He told me it’s all due to his Tempur-Pedic dog bed; in fact, he never travels without it. I asked Piper if there was something he did as a puppy he wishes he could still do. He gave it some thought and even chewed on <a href="https://www.mypetneedsthat.com/best-bones-for-dogs/">his bone</a> a moment before telling us he wished he could still sit in Mom’s (Beth’s) lap while she worked, as it was the only place comfier than his world-renowned bed.</span></p>
<p><span>Piper went on to tell me that he is 7 years old, but doesn’t feel a day over 3 in spirit. I wondered, was there something or someone that kept his saged spirit so young at heart? Piper told me it was a combination of “bark ruffff *sniff*” — or listening to the soundtrack for the “Wicked”</span> <span>musical, a good back rub and calcium-enriched dogbone every day — that did him wonders; personally, I can’t wait to try it. </span></p>
<p><span>I decided to wrap up my time with Piper by asking him where he sees himself over the next three years. Piper told me he looks forward to continuing to come to work at Wired PR and the CO+HOOTS office, eventually becoming the Chief Executive Officer of the company. If you want an intelligent and heartfelt conversation, look no further than the joy that is Piper.</span></p>
<p><b><i><img class="size-medium wp-image-13437 alignleft" src="https://cohoots.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/19620408_1571105439597530_8226931699353656750_o-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" />Herbey:</i></b></p>
<p><span>Herbey, the curious jester of the CO+HOOTS office and Piper’s Wired PR coworker, will be quick to greet you and even quicker to give you a helping hand. Don’t let his short legs fool you — this little tank makes up in hospitality what he lacks in height. </span></p>
<p><span>When I asked him what he likes to do outside of the office, he told me he enjoys the occasional long walk on the beach, but he also loves sitting on his office throne. Knowing he was adopted around six months ago, I asked him if he believes that everything happens for a reason or if we create reasons for the things that happen. He nuzzled my arm with love and said everything does happen for a reason; sometimes we just don’t know the reason. My heart felt as warm as the September heat outside. </span></p>
<p><span>I tasked Herbey if he could dive into a pool filled with anything, what it would be. He told me, “hav-hav, *tail wag*” </span><i><span>or</span></i><span> “*tongue drool* bark.” I could see his ultimatum. I know I would have a hard time choosing between a pool of throw pillows or a kale and spinach salad bar, as well. I’ve met many veggie fans in my life, but few that enjoy them as much as Herbey; however, Herbey did admit he enjoys eating just about everything. </span></p>
<p><span>I then wondered who his celebrity inspiration was. Herbey blushed a little and confided it was Bullseye, the dog from the Target commercials. I could tell he and I would get along fabulously. Before ending my visit with Herbey, I asked him if he had any must-watch movie or TV show recommendations. He said he never misses a week of “America’s Got Talent,” but is always looking for someone to watch it with him and help in voting for his favorite acts due to his lack of opposable thumbs. If you can’t wait until Wednesday for a pick-me-up MidWeek MindTweak, talk to Herbey and satisfy all your mood-boosting needs.     </span> <!--codes_iframe--></p></div>
