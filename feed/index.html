				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone’s desk setup is a little different. Some people are total minimalists, while others claim to know where everything is. While your workstation should always be yours to make your own, following great desk setup strategies can also help your productivity grow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you have a </span><a href="https://cohoots.com/locations/phoenix/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">dedicated desk</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a coworking space or a dedicated workstation at home, your surroundings impact your efficiency. This includes everything from where your work tools are placed to how far your monitor is from your face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To help you create a blueprint for your workstation, we asked our founder Jenny Poon to provide some </span><a href="https://cohoots.com/2018/03/19/our-desk-spirations/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">inspiration for your desk setup</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We’ll also explain three setup tips you can draw from her example and provide three more ideas you can easily implement.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jenny’s desk setup</span></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our founder is a self-proclaimed efficiency nut and if you’ve ever seen her getting sh*t done, you know she’s doing something right. Here’s what she has to say about her desk setup:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My desk is a super important part of my efficiency process. I make sure I have Post-its and a notepad handy, as I always take notes. I have found having a desk that has drawers has been a godsend for keeping my desk tidy and clean, but with easy access to the necessities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have a larger monitor and run off of a laptop, so I can be mobile when I need to, but when designing or working on spreadsheets, I can project up. I found out I could also connect my iPad as an extension to my screen and that has been super helpful, as I just keep my Slack on there so I can always be available via chat for my now-remote team.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why her desk setup works</span></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So how does this desk setup boost productivity? Let’s dissect the three main ergonomic strategies that Jenny uses and how you can implement them, too.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Most-used items are kept within arm’s reach.</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When organizing your desk, your most important tools should always be placed closest to your seat or standing mat. If you love jotting down notes like Jenny, keeping your pen and paper nearby will allow you to grab it in an instant, without shifting away from your primary task.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bonus points: If you keep these heavily used items in designated spots, you naturally create a physical workflow for yourself.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Cleanliness is prioritized.</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if you know where everything is, a messy desk can hinder your productivity. By keeping least-used items and knick-knacks stored away, Jenny’s desk setup minimizes distractions and allows her to efficiently navigate her workspace.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A clean desk can also feel more inviting, whereas clutter can add to your stress. In addition to investing in drawers (if your desk doesn’t include any), you may consider purchasing basic accessories like </span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/OHill-Organizer-Management-Organizing-Adhesive/dp/B071FXZBMV/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cable clips</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Simple-Trending-Supplies-Organizer-Vertical/dp/B07SNBHQ28/ref=sr_1_7?crid=31GORS15ZFSN0&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=desk+organizers&amp;qid=1591278662&amp;sprefix=desk+organ%2Caps%2C246&amp;sr=8-7"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tiered desk organizers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. It’s customized for her work habits.</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone works differently, but Jenny is always on-the-go. By using her laptop as a primary device and casting her other tech in purposeful, supporting roles, she can easily unplug, pack up and head to wherever she needs to be.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alternatively, if you’re typically stationary throughout your workday, you can make a desktop computer the star of the show to avoid switching between devices.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">3 more desk setup ideas for productivity</span></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As our founder’s example has shown, the most efficient workstations are always neat and purposeful. Here are some extra desk setup tips that you can implement to drive your productivity further along:</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Support your natural posture</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keeping an upright posture can enhance your focus, while warding off common health problems for office workers like bad backs and carpal tunnel — which, of course, can cause highly distracting aches and pains. Your desk setup can actually encourage you to sit properly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To promote good posture:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Keep your monitor at eye level.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Whether you’re sitting down or using a standing desk, your monitor should help you face forward without a hunched back, and be close enough so you’re not craning your neck.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Choose the right chair.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> An ergonomic chair can encourage you to keep your spine straight and supported. When setting it up, make sure it’s at a level that keeps your feet flat, while allowing you to reach straight for your keyboard without bent wrists.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Increase natural light</span></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.inc.com/cameron-albert-deitch/office-design-productivity-success-capital-one-study.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Natural light is key</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for greater productivity and better mental health. Positioning your desk close to a window will help you boost your happiness and your focus all at once. Natural light helps you take advantage of your circadian rhythm and stay awake, even without the coffee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Live in a box? Daylight bulbs that keep you energized are recommended.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Choose your decor wisely</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While most unnecessary items should be kept off your desk, keeping a small amount of decor can boost your mood while you’re working. Choose a few items that you love, but doesn’t take up a lot of space, such as a family photo.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Small plants are always a good option, as the presence of greenery can lead to </span><a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/office-plants-boost-productivity#:~:text=Plants%20can%20add%20more%20to,up%20to%2015%20per%20cent.&amp;text=%22Plants%20aren't%20used%20to,very%20fast%2Dvarying%20environments.%22"><span style="font-weight: 400;">15% more productivity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just make sure your decor isn’t in the way when you’re reaching for essential items.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create your happy place</span></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you have a great desk setup that’s customized for you, your workspace can be your productive place </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> your happy place. There aren’t actually any rules when it comes to designing your desk, but when you use our ergonomic strategies, you will feel your efficiency grow.</span></p>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Businesses everywhere are waking up to a need for diversity and inclusivity in the workplace. If you haven’t already, now is absolutely the time to invest in inclusion to drive measurable results — and for the greater good, of course.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://cohoots.com/about/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our team</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is focused on bringing diverse entrepreneurs together, because we know a culture of inclusion can lift up an entire community. In the same vein, creating a team filled with unique individuals whose opinions are equally valued can make a world of difference within your organization.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But why exactly are diversity and inclusion worth the effort? And how can you make it happen? We’re here to help you get the answers you need.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is diversity in the workplace exactly?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Workplace diversity occurs when employees at each level of your organization can be distinguished through their unique perspectives and experiences.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diversity can take many forms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your team may consist of people of different genders, races, sexual orientations, education levels, physical abilities and ages — all of which impact their personal experiences.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Professional diversity is important, too. Even within the same department, a diverse team will have a wide variety of skill sets and ways of thinking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re worried about accidentally hiring mortal enemies, do not fear. A commitment to diversity doesn’t mean you need to look for polar opposites. No matter how different your team members are, they should all feel connected by the same core values. This overarching unity will enable your business to benefit from the positive impact of diversity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Benefits of diversity at work</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diversity in the workplace isn’t just a fad. Business leaders stand behind it because it leads to greater efficiency and longevity. We’ll list out a few ways you can directly benefit from encouraging diversity at work, but we promise this is just the start of a million reasons why inclusion matters.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. It enhances your decision-making.</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you bring together people with unique knowledge and perspectives, you will naturally have a team that can tackle challenges from every angle. As you bounce ideas off one another, you’ll develop more creative solutions, twice as fast — and the decisions you make will be </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/company/stories/new-research-diversity-inclusion-better-decision-making-work/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">better 87% of the time</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diversity is also the key to weeding out tone-deaf marketing before it’s blasted out. When your team actually represents the diverse makeup of the greater community, you eliminate your blind spots and stay hyper-aware about how your audience may perceive your message.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. It boosts your profits.</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you invest in workplace diversity, you get returns. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just looking at gender diversity, having a more balanced mix of men and </span><a href="https://cohoots.com/2019/03/26/lessons-from-women-in-leadership/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">women in leadership</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can actually increase the likelihood of above-average profits </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/karstenstrauss/2018/01/25/more-evidence-that-company-diversity-leads-to-better-profits/#1853b0991bc7"><span style="font-weight: 400;">by 21%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diversity is also </span><a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/346229"><span style="font-weight: 400;">known to attract</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> top talent, investors and customers, so if your dedication to building a diverse team doesn’t create immediate results, it will boost and continue to boost your ROI soon enough.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. It keeps your employees engaged.</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No one wants to work for a team where they don’t feel included. Diversity is directly linked to </span><a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/au/en/pages/human-capital/articles/role-diversity-practices-inclusion-trust-employee-engagement.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">higher levels of trust</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which ultimately leads to employee engagement — a huge factor in organizational productivity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pairing diversity with a strong culture of inclusion will further help your team members feel valued and heard. Because they feel comfortable with and connected to the broader team, they’re also less likely to leave. With employee retention rates high, you won’t have to eat the </span><a href="https://www.hrdive.com/news/study-turnover-costs-employers-15000-per-worker/449142/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">extremely high cost</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of employee turnover.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to build a culture of inclusivity</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building an inclusive team is an active process that requires you to do more than stick diverse people together. Here are some tips on how you can promote and nurture a healthy, inclusive culture as you build your diverse team:</span></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Encourage collaboration.<span style="font-weight: 400;"> When your employees are working in silos, this can hinder your progress. Find ways for your team members to work together, so they can learn from each other and build off of each other’s ideas.</span></b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Offer diversity training.<span style="font-weight: 400;"> Even if you’re confident that all your team members value diversity, almost everyone has implicit biases that they need to overcome. Training can help your employees grow, while building trust and acceptance.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Support professional development.<span style="font-weight: 400;"> Once you achieve strong diversity, you need to continue engaging employees by helping them advance in their careers. This could be achieved through mentorship, a professional development stipend or a similar initiative.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Again, remember that diversity in the workplace only occurs when there’s diversity at every level. Your leadership team must reflect your commitment to inclusion, or else your efforts will be drowned by an echo chamber of decision-makers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<h3>Make diversity an ongoing commitment</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diversity isn’t created in one day, nor does inclusion continue if you fail to nurture it. Making diversity and inclusion core values in your business will help you outperform your competitors, while keeping your team fully satisfied.</span></p>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social media isn’t all cats, memes, cat memes and millennials. It’s also a massive digital community where all of your potential leads, </span><a href="https://cohoots.com/advisors/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">advisors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, investors and collaborators may be just a message away. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you prioritize social networking for business, in addition to building relationships at your </span><a href="https://cohoots.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">local coworking space</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you create more connections that guarantee your long-term growth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This article will give you clear guidance on why social networking matters and how you can use it to gain the competitive advantage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why social networking matters</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As social media increasingly becomes a digital </span><a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2016/09/14/third-places-as-community-builders/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">third place</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, its power has become impossible to ignore. Online interactions are no longer a separate world — they’re directly influencing real-life connections, both personal and professional.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, </span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2016/06/22/social-media-and-the-workplace/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">less than a quarter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of professionals are creating or strengthening business relationships through social media. This huge gap represents your opportunity to take the lead.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With </span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/fact-sheet/social-media/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">over 70% of all U.S. adults</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> maintaining at least one social media profile — and the number only rising as younger generations enter adulthood and the workforce — the time is now to use this digital space for professional networking.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">5 social networking tips for business leaders</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As is the case when you do anything in business, you don’t want to leave strategy behind when you start leveraging social media for your career growth. Use these five tips when social networking for business to maximize your time and ensure your efforts don’t go to waste:</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Build your brand first</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you’re reaching out to and engaging with other users and businesses on social media, they should get a clear picture of who you are upon visiting your page. Make sure everything from your bio to your content matches who you want to be perceived as professionally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The more consistent you are across all platforms — this may include using the same handle, using matching profile pictures and posting with the same frequency — the stronger your brand will be.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Online attention spans are extremely short, so it’s important that visitors can recognize what you do and remember who you are after a quick skim of your profile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re an established entrepreneur and want to further enhance your brand on social media, you may consider </span><a href="https://www.thebalancesmb.com/how-to-develop-your-brand-strategy-2295187"><span style="font-weight: 400;">developing a brand strategy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for yourself. This will help you define who you are, communicate your message clearly and speak to the right audience. Your strategy will also help you create guidelines for your voice and visuals.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Prioritize the right channels</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not every channel is equally suited for professional networking in your specific industry. Just because LinkedIn is designed to help anyone network doesn’t mean your specific audience is there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have a game plan for what types of professionals you want to reach out to — list out specific people if you have anyone in mind — and figure out what platforms they’re using. Use advanced search tools on LinkedIn, Facebook and Twitter to narrow down your searches faster.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, keep in mind that just because someone’s on a channel doesn’t mean it’s the right place to network with them. If someone is clearly using their Instagram page just to post dog and baby pictures, they’re probably not looking for professional connections on the app.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Join professional groups</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facebook Groups can be your go-to resource when you want to make new virtual connections, need support or give back to your peers. These virtual groups are mini communities of their own that instantly give you something in common with other members.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To find some local business groups or worldwide industry-based groups, search by keywords like “Arizona business” or “marketing” and join (or request to join) groups that sound interesting and helpful. You can always leave if they turn out to be poorly moderated, with too much spam or too many distractions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though not as plentiful, you can also search for groups on LinkedIn for more formal networking.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Personalize your pitch</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On social media, where authenticity rules, others can see right through you if you’re not genuine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A first rule of thumb is to never directly copy, paste and send your messages to every single person you reach out to. Whether you’re reaching out on LinkedIn, Twitter, or somewhere else, your recipient is unlikely to respond if you don’t show why you’re reaching out to them specifically.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your pitch should also be unique from any email-based pitches you send out. Even when you’re social networking for business, social media tends to be a more personable platform where your “best regards” probably aren’t the best way to close out a message.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">5. Offer value first</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People don’t buy products and services. They buy the value the products and services provide.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similarly, your pitch will be most effective if you create value before you try to sell. While salesy messages can easily be ignored, messages that offer a </span><a href="https://cohoots.com/speaker-series/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">helpful resource</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a free trial or even a call to simply connect will usually get you at least one response.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lasting professional relationships — which are more valuable than one-time sales — can only begin if there’s mutual benefit and a human connection.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Master virtual networking</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social media makes it possible for professionals to connect anytime, from just about anywhere. Even if you live in the middle of nowhere or there are no networking events in your area, there’s no excuse not to start social networking for business — as long as you have WiFi, that is.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you’ve built up your virtual network, you may start planning some in-person collaborations soon. When you’re ready to take your professional relationships offline, </span><a href="https://cohoots.com/meeting-rooms-event-space/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">grab a meeting room in a creative space</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to inspire your strongest ideas.</span></p></div>

<h3><b>CITY OF MESA AND CO+HOOTS PARTNER TO LAUNCH NEW DIGITAL PLATFORM TO HELP SMALL BUSINESSES AFFECTED BY PANDEMIC</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">CO+HOOTS’ new resource hub re-envisions </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">government technical assistance programs.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Phoenix and Mesa, Ariz: July 13, 2020 — CO+HOOTS, a globally-recognized entrepreneur support organization, today announced the launch of HUUB, a robust digital platform to support local governments in revitalizing small businesses during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. The City of Mesa will be the first to apply this technology driven-approach to business recovery, utilizing CO+HOOTS’ HUUB network to launch the Mesa CARES Technical Assistance Program and Resource Center.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The launch of this digital platform will bring community partner organizations and leaders together to specifically help small businesses in Mesa. In one central place, business owners will have access to engaging and relevant webinars that will provide tactical on-demand solutions, invaluable peer-to-peer groups, funding opportunities and the ability to book on-the-fly sessions with top advisors and consultants. Qualifying Mesa businesses that qualify will receive training, education, and services valued at $15,000 to help them emerge from the pandemic. There are already more than 100 businesses that have applied and been accepted into the Mesa CARES Technical Assistance Program.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Given the strong demand for recovery support due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we&#8217;re excited to see Mesa take an active approach in responding to the needs of their business community” said Jenny Poon, founder and CEO of CO+HOOTS.  “By partnering with the City of Mesa, we aim to improve the resiliency of the business community that is the backbone of Mesa while creating efficiencies for the City. We are excited and prepared to take our decade of experience in incubating entrepreneur communities and be of service in this critical time. With our digital platform, cities and community partners can now provide a faster response to small business owners in need and help cities do more, no matter where they are.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mesa Cares for Small Businesses resource center is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">made possible by the federal Coronavirus Relief Fund under the CARES Act. Many of Mesa’s community partners will be coming together to provide resources to entrepreneurs through this platform including A New Leaf, LISC, Chicanos Por La Causa, Local First Arizona, Mesa Chamber of Commerce, Benedictine University at Mesa, Northern Arizona University and the East Valley Hispanic Chamber.</span><span style="font-size: 20px;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;More than half of small business owners surveyed by the City of Mesa said they were significantly affected by COVID-19,&#8221; Mayor John Giles said. &#8220;The Mesa CARES Small Business Technical Assistance Program serves small business owners by connecting them to the individualized help they need. We are thrilled to partner with CO+HOOTS to offer easy access to quality business support that strengthens Mesa’s economic prosperity.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To qualify for free access to the platform and funding resources, Mesa entrepreneurs and small business owners can apply at </span><a href="https://mesa.joinhuub.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">mesa.joinhuub.com/</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Applications are open right now and are on a first-come, first-serve basis. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">One of HUUB’s main objectives is to directly help entrepreneurs launch, grow and scale their businesses. And because the platform combines CO+HOOTS’ community-building and incubation framework with technology, it also provides the necessary tools for local governments to measure success, manage consultants for technical assistance and make smarter decisions. The detailed reporting and impact tracking gives economic development teams the ability to scale their support through technology and quickly identify the changing needs of their business community, allowing more time to focus on retaining businesses and recruiting new ones.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Having the “next best idea” does not make you a great entrepreneur. Try having courage, empathy and resilience. Diana G. Muturia encompasses all of those qualities and so much more. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her journey to opening up the doors for women in the tech field has not been without its challenges. Originally from Kenya, she immigrated to the U.S. by way of Texas to pursue her degree in math and mechanical engineering. After falling on hard times, she dropped out of college and moved to Arizona where she began cleaning homes. It was then that she met many other service providers, especially in the Black and Hispanic communities, which led her to create her app; Clyn (pronounced Clean). </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Clyn is a mobile platform that optimizes the cleaning industry by connecting homeowners to home service providers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We had the opportunity to interview Diana as the introduction of a series highlighting the stories of entrepreneurs of color in the Valley. We aim to amplify their voices and give insight on how to not only survive but thrive amidst current and future times of hardship. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>There are a lot of barriers women of color face to even break into the tech field, how were you able to navigate that industry and allow your voice to be heard? </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No [woman] is an island. The badass women in the Valley such as Cindy Gordon, Valeri Marsh, Jalia Pettis and Shatha Barbour to name a few have been such great pillars to Clyn. Whether it’s through connecting us with their inner circles, advising, or offering their expertise and resources. They gave me, and ultimately Clyn, a platform to be heard. Matter of fact, women of Arizona are badass! We lift each other up with every opportunity we get.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>What has your experience been connecting with other Arizona entrepreneurs?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Arizona entrepreneurs are like the cactus; resilient. I am proud of how far Arizona entrepreneurs have come. They have made great strides with resources the fraction of what other entrepreneurs have in larger cities. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>What is the biggest lesson you learned from operating your own business?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I learned that my business will only grow as much as I grow as an individual. The company made a huge pivot in 2020 when we started challenging ourselves. Asking ourselves what we need to work on in terms of our skills, communication and perspectives. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>What advice would you give to other young people who are considering becoming an entrepreneur? </b><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline"> Might as well start now.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> You will fail about 3-4 times before you actually succeed, so don’t waste any time. It sounds cliche but you have to play the long game. The long game means you need to keep failing with enthusiasm until everything clicks. That might take a few months, but realistically it will take you a few years. So start now, and do what you truly enjoy!</span></li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline"> Think far into the future.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> I often have to remind young entrepreneurs, including myself, that we live in a world where everything seems to be instant. We’ve become remarkably impatient. Gary Vee’s wine library’s growth was very small in its first 3 years. Jeff Bezos’ Amazon bookstore didn’t see profit for its first whopping 7 years. Facebook is an anomaly; we like to romanticize and have the perception that it’s the standard, when it’s in fact the opposite. Most successful companies we know today started before they were understood; we have been there. Now that we are tipping into the era where the market gets us, it will no longer settle for less than what we deliver here at Clyn.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline"> Don’t go at it alone.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> Bring together friends and family members that you look up to as the hustlers and grinders and make a team. You will accomplish more together.</span></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Lastly, do you plan on starting any new initiatives or continue to expand your platform?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> The goal is to expand our work under Clyn. We have some tech heavy projects and humanitarian initiatives we are excited to dive into after Clyn 2.0’s launch this June. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Diana’s courage throughout her journey has opened the doors for many other women in entrepreneurship to push past their obstacles and achieve success. Her story is not only inspiring but a true testament to her cactus-like resilience that she displays so well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To learn more about Clyn visit </span><a href="https://www.clynapp.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400">https://www.clynapp.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> and to connect with Diana you can find her @DianaMuturia on Instagram and LinkedIn.</span></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve ever looked up how to get smarter (haven’t we all?), reading more is probably on your to-do list. After all, some of the most successful people around make books a staple in their lives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just to name a few: Warren Buffett reads at least </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/27/warren-buffetts-key-tip-for-success-read-500-pages-a-day.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">500 pages per day</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Mark Cuban reads four to </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/31/what-mark-cuban-reads-every-day.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">five hours daily</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Oprah Winfrey and Reese Witherspoon both built massive followings from their monthly book clubs alone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But when your goal is to hone your entrepreneurial skills, how do you know what business books to read? Blindly picking “Twilight” off the shelf probably won’t help you much.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve put together a list of modern business book recommendations that you can put on your reading list to maximize your professional growth. Whether you’re a business owner, freelancer or just an entrepreneurial spirit, these picks can help you diversify your knowledge and apply it into your day-to-day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t worry — there’s no young adult fiction or $200 textbooks here.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why read business books?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Excellent reading habits may be a characteristic shared by many of the world’s top entrepreneurs, but correlation doesn’t imply causation, right? It makes sense to be a little skeptical when your time is on the line.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the positive effects of reading have been proven time and time again. Not only does it increase your vocabulary and make you seem like the most intelligent person on the block, but it </span><a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/what-does-reading-do-to-your-brain-these-5-effects-are-pretty-astounding-74676"><span style="font-weight: 400;">boosts your memory</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and learning capacity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you’re reading about business specifically, you’re filling up that learning capacity with knowledge that really matters. This knowledge can then be applied directly into your operations, strategies and much more.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Three best business books for strategy-building</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The heart of your company is business strategy. When you’re building your master plan, you need to take as much of the guesswork out of the equation as possible. These three books will do the trick:</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. “Traction: Get a Grip on Your Business”</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Traction: Get a Grip on Your Business” by Gino Wickman is one of </span><a href="https://cohoots.com/about/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">our founders</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">’ go-to guides for making decisions or evaluating any approach.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This business book offers a practical system for strengthening the most important parts of your organization, including your vision, data and team. The result is greater efficiency and less stress.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best part is, the book is interactive, so you’ll have actual action items to take away.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Traction-Get-Grip-Your-Business/dp/1936661837"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get the book here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. “The End of Competitive Advantage: How to Keep Your Strategy Moving as Fast as Your Business”</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Written by strategy expert Rita Gunther McGrath, this is the business book to read if you want to make sure your approach is fit for the modern world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The End of Competitive Advantage” acknowledges that change is happening quicker than ever — in every industry — and teaches you how to be quick on your feet. Instead of giving you one surefire path, this book will get you an evergreen mindset that will help you constantly adapt your business strategy.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/End-Competitive-Advantage-Strategy-Business/dp/1422172813"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get the book here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. “The Startup Handbook: Your Step-By-Step, Straight-Talking Guide To Building A Great Business In Your Life”</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many startups don’t make it past their first year. Even if you’ve joined a coworking space — which can make you </span><a href="https://www.business.com/articles/5-things-to-consider-when-looking-for-a-coworking-space/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">four times more likely to succeed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — you’ll encounter many hurdles as you go. But Morris Grant knows that all hurdles can be overcome with a solid business plan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In “The Startup Handbook,” Grant walks you through realistic business tips, ways to stay motivated and many mistakes that you can easily avoid.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Startup-Handbook-Step-Step-Straight-Talking-ebook/dp/B01FWDFV44"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get the book here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two best business books for people management</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A business can’t run itself — it needs people. But you and your team can only be at your best if you can continue to stay motivated and grow together. These are the two business books to read when you want to maximize your team’s every effort:</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. “Radical Candor: Be a Kick-Ass Boss Without Losing Your Humanity”</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Far too many business book lists fail to include voices from </span><a href="https://cohoots.com/2019/03/26/lessons-from-women-in-leadership/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">women in leadership</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which is a shame because they’re all missing out on Kim Scott’s guide on being an empathetic leader.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Radical Candor” is all about building a culture of feedback that lifts your team up without knocking anyone down. This book will help you nurture your relationships within your organization, so you can move forward at the same pace.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Radical-Candor-Kim-Scott/dp/B01KTIEFEE"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get the book here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. “Managing Oneself: The Key to Success”</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes, it’s not managing other people you need to worry about — it’s managing yourself. Peter F. Drucker, who is known as the father of modern management, helps you stay accountable and lead by example.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Managing Oneself” is a short, practical guide for anyone who wants to become a better CEO for themselves or for their teams.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Managing-Oneself-Peter-F-Drucker/dp/163369304X"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get the book here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two best business books for boosting ROI</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So you have your overarching strategy down and your team running at max efficiency. The next step is making sure you understand how to stand out in your market to continuously profit more. These two business books can help:</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. “Blue Ocean Strategy: How to Create Uncontested Market Space and Make the Competition Irrelevant”</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Blue Ocean Strategy” has been a massive hit since its 2015 release for good reason. In the book, W. Chan Kim and Renée Mauborgne give you actionable tips to escape the world of cutthroat competition and captivate your own unique audience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kim and Mauborgne explain how you can create ‘blue oceans’ (or new market spaces) that help you become the one and only choice for your customers.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blue-Ocean-Strategy-Expanded-Uncontested/dp/1625274491"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get the book here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. “Purple Cow: Transform Your Business by Being Remarkable”</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seth Godin is known as a modern entrepreneurship master and his marketing classic shows you how to become a master, too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Purple Cow” shows you how to make your product or service more marketable and how to easily differentiate yourself. This book offers plenty of straightforward tips, paired with real-world examples, that any business owner can implement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Purple-Cow-New-Transform-Remarkable/dp/1591843170">Get the book here</a>.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Master new business skills</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Expanding your knowledge will make you the business leader you want to be. With our recommendations, you’ll have enjoyable business books to read that help you further your career without making your brain hurt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Start gathering these incredible reads from (preferably) your local bookstore, Amazon or your local library to get yourself into a growth mindset and maybe become the next Warren Buffett.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want a quick business read in the meantime, learn </span><a href="https://cohoots.com/2019/04/08/leveraging-remote-work/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">how the world’s most innovative companies are leveraging remote work</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It’ll only take six minutes!</span></p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p class="graf graf--p">We are facing two infections. COVID and SYSTEMIC RACISM. Both require a deconstruction of every aspect of our lives to properly combat. Let’s look at how our government responded to COVID at a city level. Here in Phoenix our city split up into teams, all tackling different issues.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Some teams worked on supporting small biz, some on education, some on social services, discussions on how police need to enforce safety measures, close convos with health department etc. Together a plan was hatched to quickly address the many challenges that come with a massive epidemic. The result was rapid response, support and even reform. Grants were launched at a local level, regulations were loosened to allow faster production of a vaccine. People were sent money. We reshaped an entire federal loan program and reclassified applicants so more could apply. Conversely, SYSTEMIC RACISM VIRUS has led to thousands of deaths annually and a consistent backwards mobility of an entire population. The government has had one strategy: suppression. Led by our tyrant president, our government activated military, curfews and attempt to control the story.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">One virus attacks fast with a 2% fatality rate and can be clearly seen. The other is silent, slower and has rooted itself in every single human on our planet. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-06/race-and-police-shootings-what-new-research-says">The latter also results in black people being 2.5x likely to be shot</a> and one in three going to prison. If we aren’t addressing the systemic racism virus that has infected us all like the public health issue it is, then we aren’t treating it at all. We have seen how quickly government can shift and apply support under a pandemic, the same approach should be taken.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="graf graf--p"><span style="font-size: 20px;"><em><strong>The latter also results in black people being 2.5x likely to be shot and one in three going to prison.</strong></em></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="graf graf--p">This racism pandemic has affected every sector of our society, from education to economics, from police enforcement to public policy. From our innovation ecosystem to our internet infrastructure. It all slants to support the division and marginalization of black communities. While it may seem impossible to tackle racism in America, I’m confident if we took the same approach we took with COVID we’d move the needle. Divide up into teams, collaborate, identify one small change you can make every day and collectively we will push the boulder up the hill.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Every government/industry/biz/individual should assess what role it has played in creating the inequities that exist and begin devising plans to attack this virus so it doesn’t mutate to a new strain. First step, is realizing it is a man-made virus and we are all infected.</p>

<p>CO+HOOTS has always believed businesses in the community have a voice and should use that voice to take a stance. We are a part of the community and strive to uphold our community’s values and basic rights. As a minority-owned organization that is deeply rooted in diversity and inclusion with a mission to support the underrepresented, CO+HOOTS stands in solidarity with Black communities and recognizes the pressing significance and necessity of the #BlackLivesMatter movement. As a stakeholder in the health of our community’s economy, we know our innovation ecosystem would not thrive without the leading-edge contributions of our Black community.</p>
<p>Our hearts are hurting and furious over the continuing acts of violence against our Black communities in the United States, and most recently, the senseless murders of Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery and George Floyd. May they rest in peace, love and power. True justice must be served. This isn’t about minimizing other communities&#8217; struggles. Those need to be uplifted, too. But the long history of police violence against Black communities is just part of the immense breadth of injustices Black communities experience in this country, no matter the system.</p>
<p>Our hearts hurt, but our spirit isn’t broken. There is so much that can be done to become better allies,  spread awareness and take action to disrupt racial injustices. We hope you join us. We will be sharing what we all can do to become a better ally at whatever level you are currently comfortable in, such as listening to, uplifting and amplifying Black voices and experiences; and confronting racial injustices you encounter in your professional and personal networks even when uncomfortable, especially among family and friends.</p>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At CO+HOOTS, inclusion forms the core of who we are. Many of our member companies and members share that foundational value. One of those is Melanie Isaacs, who founded social enterprise Pal Experiences to create digital tools to help service providers become more inclusive for families with autism and other special abilities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since its founding in 2012, Pal Experiences has positively changed the experiences for these families at several public and private spaces. Pal Experiences has not only made its partner organizations more aware of the issue but also helped change their processes to accommodate these families like never before.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because of Melanie’s landscape-changing work, Pal Experiences was recently named Grant Thornton LLP’s 2020 “Purple Paladin,” a prestigious national prize and award that supports nonprofits that tackle real issues and provides them a nationwide platform to support their mission. Currently, there are only three Purple Paladin awards that are being endorsed by Grant Thornton. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pal Experiences is the first nonprofit from Arizona to be named a Purple Paladin. This program includes $10,000 in funding, the production of a spotlight video, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">an awareness campaign including a press release and social posts, an internal staff fundraiser for Pal Experiences and consulting. Pal Experiences will have a team of Grant Thornton employees to assist with business planning, strategy and volunteering. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the support of Grant Thornton, Melanie is able to expand her mission on a national level. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are a small non-profit with a small voice, and the most important thing to us is to get the word out there that we have these tools, and that it is important,” Melanie said. “By selecting us to be a Purple Paladin, Grant Thornton has given us a mountain to shout from, and mountains are incredibly helpful for startups.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grant Thornton LLP, founded in 1924, is the U.S. member firm of Grant Thornton International Ltd; and one of the world’s leading organizations in independent audit, tax, and advisory firms. Its Purple Paladin program is an initiative that helps emerging organizations with a social impact. Its website states, “Real heroes don’t wear shining armor. They are everyday people who take on real issues.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Dec. 12, 2019, Laura Elits, Grant Thornton’s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Corporate Social Responsibility Leader,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reached out to Melanie on LinkedIn regarding Pal Experiences. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“She said she found us online and was eager to learn more </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">I filled out an application, had a phone interview, and the last step of the process was a meeting with the CEO, Brad Preber,” Melanie explained.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grant Thornton is a huge sponsor of the PGA, and the executive team was at the Waste Management Phoenix Open golf tournament. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My meeting was set up the morning of the tournament,” Melanie said. “I brought a presentation and dressed in a blazer. I was told my meeting would happen after the CEO welcomed the Grant Thornton employees. Instead, he called me up and announced we had won! I was completely, totally surprised! It was amazing.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brad Preber said in a press release that Pal Experiences was the ideal Purple Paladin, “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They already have many partner organizations serving as ‘Pal Places’ — and Grant Thornton hopes to help them add more across the nation, while also helping them increase their use of technology to improve their services.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Melanie never had a plan to create a nonprofit or social enterprise; until a chance encounter while she was working toward a masters in marine biology at Western Illinois University. One day on a train ride back from the aquarium where she worked, she happened upon a boy who was really excited about the aquarium staff t-shirt she was wearing. After answering all of his questions about the aquarium, she asked the family if they would like to visit there one day, but the family surprisingly and promptly replied, “No.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The parents explained that their son had autism, which made it nearly impossible for him to truly enjoy the experience. Visiting such a public space would be too overwhelming for him, something he could never do. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Struck by this story, Melanie started her journey to redefine the meaning of inclusivity.  She realized that most of the public spaces were accessible for families with some disabilities through the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), but very few spaces were set up for families with members who are autistic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the United States, 1 in 6 children have a developmental disability and nearly 70% of all families with children on the Autism spectrum experience social isolation. Not being able to ever go to the movies, a theme park or the aquarium, are situations unimaginable for many of these families. With the founding of Pal Experiences, Melanie has made it her mission to help those families successfully engage in activities within their communities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pal Experiences offer technology-based learning tools to help families prepare to visit a public space. Video materials and picture-based feedback tools help Pal Experiences’ partners optimize their tools to provide an amazing experience for all families. Created with a true passion to improve accessibility for all, Pal Experiences has partnered with companies such as the world-renowned Musical Instrument Museum to improve visits for guests of all abilities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We believe that it can be socially and economically transformative for a diverse spectrum of people to participate in the activities many of us take for granted.” Melanie said.</span></p>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Below is the final part of a 3-part series on what mainstreet businesses can do right now to shift their business in the changing COVID-19 environment. Read Part 2 <a href="https://cohoots.com/2020/04/10/businesses-tactics-in-a-covid19-world-part-2-generating-revenue/">here.</a> </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /> <i>If you’re stuck, reach out. CO+HOOTS is hosting weekly financial/legal information sessions to support personalized guidance during this time. We are here for you. Learn more here: </i><a href="http://bit.ly/eventsatco"><i>bit.ly/eventsatco</i></a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8212;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of us have felt a little useless as we’ve holed up in our homes. As our first responders and medical professionals help those infected, what can the rest of us do after we’re done binging Netflix and eating our fourth round of takeout? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I begin thinking about America, post-COVID, I am excited about all that needs to be done for our cities. Yes, things look and likely will be dire. That also means there is opportunity to start anew in what will be a different economic landscape. I think my fellow entrepreneurial friends who survived the last recession are starting to feel this itch too — the landscape is ripe for rebuilding and it is our job to do it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nothing brings us together like a common enemy. And that enemy is not human, it’s COVID-19. There are a few things you can do to start contributing to the rebuilding of our economy, I encourage you to first think about strengthening yourself. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Self-Care</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a person who is a quick starter but is constantly anxious, I take time to center myself by continuously reinvesting in myself. To be ready for what’s to come, you need to have the right mindset and have the correct knowledge and skills; or at least a basic understanding of what will be needed. Here are some ideas to tackle this type of Self-Care:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t forget to take a break and step outside. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone is struggling with anxiety and fear right now, don’t forget to check in with others and there are free therapists to talk to. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try meditation: I love the </span><a href="http://breathepeople.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Breathe People app</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (also can be found on spotify). </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you thought technology is important for business, this new post-COVID-19 world has upped the technology ante. </span><a href="https://www.promineotech.com/scholarship"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Promineo Tech</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://dash.generalassemb.ly/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">General Assembly </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">are launching scholarships for coding bootcamps for individuals who want to begin upskilling to a new industry.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our own LevelUp Incubator at CO+HOOTS is offering </span><a href="http://cohoots.com/levelup"><span style="font-weight: 400;">free access to the next Rapid Launch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> program to help newly unemployed individuals build their side hustle business. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></h2>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Future</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If we start working now, we can structure a future that makes sense for so many more people. If we, as rebuilders, had the opportunity to create a version of the world that worked better, what would it look like? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Would retail/restaurants have more reasons to begin building businesses that live beyond physical walls, while also finding solutions to somehow create the experience people still crave from your establishments? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Would educators develop new education models that serve all learning styles while giving our teachers more support resources to nurture tomorrow’s innovators?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Would our leaders of consultancies redefine what and how our work is done? Pass a national standard for maternity leave or minimum wage?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Would startups develop a business model that isn’t only defined by back-breaking growth or IPOs, but by impact, which in turn, will still positively affect your bottom line?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Would housing be built to support all income levels?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Can we elect officials without them selling their values to the highest bidder?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For entrepreneur support organizations like mine at CO+HOOTS, can we challenge the existing model of entrepreneurship by making it possible for more people to own and thrive in business?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It takes courage to take action when the whole world seems to be falling apart. But if there is ever a time to fake courage, it is now. </span></p>
