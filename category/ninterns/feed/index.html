				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p>Getting started as an entrepreneur can seem like a daunting task, but taking initiative and being willing to learn can lead to a chain reaction of incredible results. We built our internship program to help students reach their entrepreneurial goals, regardless of industry, and gain a community of supporters to help them succeed. We&#8217;re proud to bring on board a new ninja intern who exemplifies the proactive spirit of entrepreneurship.</p>
<h3>Meet Jeron Artest</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-15616" src="https://cohoots.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_6676-1024x683.jpg" alt="Jeron Artest ninja intern" width="456" height="304" /></p>
<p>Jeron Artest joins our team as our new nintern for the fall and spring semesters, and we can&#8217;t wait to see what he accomplishes.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re already incredibly impressed by Jeron&#8217;s wisdom and determination, and he&#8217;s already on his way toward his major career goals. He is a high school student who already knows how to code, recently traveled to China to further his basketball dreams and is committed to achieving the goals he has set for himself.</p>
<h5>His goals:</h5>
<ul>
<li>Learn how to work within a team in an office</li>
<li>Work on different projects to improve/hone programming skills and learn new skills</li>
<li>Networking with others in the same/similar field</li>
<li>Event planning</li>
</ul>
<h5>Why he wanted to work at CO+HOOTS:</h5>
<p>I wanted to work at CO+HOOTS to personally experience the inner workings of a business while also being exposed to other businesses at the same time. It&#8217;s just such a perfect experience. Also, I like dogs, and there are a lot of office dogs here.</p>
<h5>What he believes makes a community successful:</h5>
<p>A community is successful when everyone supports each other unconditionally, whether it&#8217;s by pointing them towards the right direction or personally assisting each other.</p>
<h5>Why he believes being proactive at a young age is important:</h5>
<p>By being proactive at a &#8220;young&#8221; age, you&#8217;ll make your life easier. It&#8217;s like procrastinating on an assignment. If you do it too late, it might not be as good as if you did it early. Being proactive doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean finding a job right now or taking extra hard classes. It can be as simple as going to meetups, or contacting people on LinkedIn or even Twitter. It all benefits your future without all the stress of being an adult.</p>
<h3>Five tips for students to reach their goals by Jeron</h3>
<p>At CO+HOOTS, we believe that age does not have to be a barrier to achieving big goals. We support our our nonprofit arm <a href="http://cohootsfdn.org">CO+HOOTS Foundation</a>&#8216;s efforts to help high school students like Jeron bring their ideas to life at <a href="http://ycmsummit.com">Youth Changemaker Summit</a> and beyond. Sometimes, achieving goals starts with a few simple actions, including these tips written by Jeron:</p>
<p>1. Learn all the things. Any knowledge is the best knowledge.</p>
<p>2. Do what you love so you make the most of your time.</p>
<p>3. Find people who have similar interests to yours. Networks are important.</p>
<p>4. Communicate. It helps everyone around you and yourself understand what&#8217;s going on.</p>
<p>5. Write down your goals and a rough roadmap you can take to reach them.</p>
<h3>Jeron beyond the coworking space</h3>
<h5>Hometown:</h5>
<p>I was born in New York, New York, but I consider home to be Los Angeles.</p>
<h5>What are your own personal hopes and dreams?</h5>
<ul>
<li>Become an entrepreneur</li>
<li>Own several (mainly software-based) businesses; creating/exiting; repeat</li>
<li>Turn current concepts into actual revenue-generating businesses</li>
<li>Become an NBA player</li>
</ul>
<h5>What should the CO+HOOTS community know about you?</h5>
<p>I love trying new types of food. I always try to find a unique place to eat wherever I travel.</p>
<h5>What is one thing people don&#8217;t know about you?</h5>
<p>Nobody knows that I practice yoga.</p>
<h5>Why are you so awesome?</h5>
<p>I am so awesome because I am always learning new things. <!--codes_iframe--></p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><strong>Hometown:</strong> Tempe, AZ</p>
<p><strong>Why did you want to work at CO+HOOTS?</strong></p>
<p>I fell in love with Jenny Poon&#8217;s work and applied for an internship. Honestly, I wasn&#8217;t sure I would be working in such a welcoming environment. I love it here.</p>
<p><strong>What are your hopes and dreams at CO+HOOTS?</strong></p>
<p>At the moment, I am working towards my degree, but I have thought of starting up a company with my best friend once or twice. I hope to build the confidence and the experience that could help me consider making that dream a reality.</p>
<p><strong>Members in CO+HOOTS may be able to help you as well&#8230; What are your own personal hopes and dreams?</strong></p>
<p>My personal hopes and dreams are for travel. I want to go as many places as possible for both work and play. 3D Art is a personal passion of mine and with my graphic design degree, I hope to work with my hands, constantly building in the physical 3D space as well as the Virtual 3D space.</p>
<p><strong>If you had a 100 billion dollars, you would&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>HAH, probably blow it all on silly things. I&#8217;m terrible with money&#8230; Honestly though, I would probably invest in property. Everybody needs a place to rest their head, right? But 100 billion is a lot of money.</p>
<p><strong>What should the CO+HOOTS community know about you?</strong></p>
<p>Umm&#8230; I work at the zoo on the weekends?</p>
<p><strong>What is the one thing people don&#8217;t know about you?</strong></p>
<p>When I first started my Facebook profile, I set my birthday as April 1 as an April Fools prank for those who got the notification. I thought it was funny at the time.</p>
<p><strong>Why are you awesome?</strong></p>
<p>I am a sucker for puns. <!--codes_iframe--></p></div>

His openness to exploring (and admitting) any and all passions is why he fits our culture so well, but his ability to #GSD is the reason why it&#8217;s such a pleasure to have him as one of our ninterns! Did you know Jeremy has already built a custom app for us?</p>
<p>Josh Hanson is a design extraordinaire with an eye for all things branding. Whether it&#8217;s hands-on work or something on the screens, he&#8217;s prepared to help and ready to learn (and probably ready to climb on furniture for the sake of design). We&#8217;re excited to see more of Josh&#8217;s amazing work &#8212; and what his next tattoo may be!</p>

<h3>Jeremy</h3>
<p><img class="wp-image-14861 alignright" src="https://cohoots.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_5299-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="434" height="289" /></p>
<p><b>Hometown:</b> Glendale, AZ</p>
<p><strong>Why did you want to work at CO+HOOTS?</strong></p>
<p>I am in love with what this space and the Foundation provides to its members and what it stands for. Working on a small team with a shared responsibility to enable people to chase their passions is a no-brainer for me. Very excited to be chosen for the internship this summer and to have a chance to contribute to the community!</p>
<p><strong>What are your hopes and dreams at CO+HOOTS?</strong></p>
<p>I hope to learn all the things! And to contribute wherever I can to make things more efficient, more accessible and more helpful.</p>
<p><b>Members in CO+HOOTS may be able to help you as well… What are your own personal hopes and dreams?</b></p>
<p>My ideal dream would be to one day end up at NASA or SpaceX building software for space exploration. On a more down to Earth level (teehee), I want to help solve all kinds of difficult problems with technology, whatever language or platform that takes me to. Anyone working in the software or web development world that is willing to share their story would be a true hero of mine!</p>
<p><b>If you had 100 billion dollars, you would…</b></p>
<p>That&#8217;s an insane amount of money for a single person to have, so I&#8217;d put away 100 million or so to comfortably live off of and then spend the rest of my life giving the remainder away.</p>
<p><b>What should the CO+HOOTS community know about you?</b></p>
<p>I&#8217;m currently a full-time college student studying Computer Science. I spent 14 years working for a large financial firm in Scottsdale (my first real job ever!) and decided it was time to pursue my dream of being a software developer. Scary and exciting!</p>
<p><b>What is one thing people don’t know about you?</b></p>
<p>I&#8217;m secretly not awesome. Also, I have an unhealthy obsession with Funko Pop figures which has only recently been hampered by the whole full-time college student thing.</p>
<p><b>Why are you so awesome? </b></p>
<p>Well this is awkward&#8230;</p>
<h3>Josh</h3>

<p><strong>Why did you want to work at CO+HOOTS? </strong></p>
<p>I heard amazing things about Eeko Studio/CO+HOOTS through a classmate at school, so I had to check it out. It has been awesome learning about how CO+HOOTS helps entrepreneurs and the community.</p>
<p><strong>What are your hopes and dreams at CO+HOOTS?</strong><br /> I would love to help the any design aspect the team may need. I love print work, branding and making prototypes with my hands.</p>
<p><strong>Members in CO+HOOTS may be able to help you as well&#8230; What are your own personal hopes and dreams?</strong></p>
<p>I would love to learn many different aspects of graphic design from the various team members while interning here. Also to make great connections with my fellow team members, but also the CO+HOOTS members.</p>
<p><b>If you had 100 billion dollars, you would…</b></p>
<p>Most people would say they would stop working, but I&#8217;m not that person. Of course I wouldn&#8217;t work too much, but I love to travel so I would definitely spend some time traveling the world. A hundred billion dollars is a lot of money, so I would of course share some with charities. I just try and live a simple life. I&#8217;m a no frills kind of guy.</p>
<p><b>What should the CO+HOOTS community know about you?</b></p>
<p>I love to travel and have been to many places here in the U.S. and in Europe. Feel free to ask me any questions. I also love dogs, the bigger the better. Oh, and macaroni and cheese is my favorite food.</p>
<p><b>What is one thing people don’t know about you?</b></p>
<p>I have a total of 12 tattoos.</p>
<p><b>Why are you so awesome? </b></p>
<p>There are many reasons why I&#8217;m awesome! I have tattoos, I&#8217;m a graphic designer, I get along with just about anyone and I&#8217;m a &#8220;go with the flow&#8221; kind of guy. <!--codes_iframe--></p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><em>The days of remote positions being purely underpaid telemarketing jobs are gone.</em></p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.studyfinds.org/survey-one-five-office-employees-work-remotely/">One in five people work remotely</a> and over 50% of workers say their company has a work from home policy. What this remote work trend has created is an entirely new workplace lifestyle <em>and a chance for diversification like we have never seen before.</em></p>
<h3>With the ability to recruit from all over the world, we’re in the middle of two major shifts in the workforce.</h3>
<p><strong>Shift One:</strong> Companies have access to talent regardless of location</p>
<p><strong>Shift Two:</strong> Remote workers are having healthier and happier work experiences</p>
<p>InVision, a digital design platform, is looking toward the future and capitalizing on these shifts. They run an entire 700-person team fully remote — and they have been doing so for seven years.</p>
<p>InVision’s Chief People Officer, Mark Frein, told <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/invision-startup-all-employees-work-remotely-2018-9">Business Insider</a> he firmly believes hiring from any location gives InVision an edge as a technology company. Frein isn’t limited to finding talent in New York City and has diversified his workforce to talent around the world. He’s capitalizing on the statistics that show the value of remote workers (<a href="https://biz30.timedoctor.com/remote-workers-infographic/">click here for an infographic on remote work statistics</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li>Ninety-one percent of remote workers get more work done outside of the office</li>
<li>Remote workers are happier with their work than office workers</li>
<li>Remote workers feel more valued at work than office workers</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>“It’s about results, not where your IP address is. We care about what you’re able to do or achieve.” Mark Frein</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Companies like Basecamp, GitLab, Buffer and Splice have also embraced a fully remote team. Basecamp’s founder Jason Fried, transcribed his remote working business strategy into a best-selling book in 2009, <em>Rework</em>. In his book, he explained how remote work was an integral part of his company’s success.</p>
<p><strong>With only a remote team, Fried has amassed over three million Basecamp users.</strong></p>
<p>As the founder of <a href="https://cohoots.com/">CO+HOOTS</a>, a nationally ranked coworking office based in Phoenix, I watch business owners capitalize on having remote teams on a daily basis.</p>
<p>When it comes to innovation and closing business deals, the businesses capitalizing on the freedom that remote work provides are winning.</p>
<p><strong>The future of the workforce is here and this is how to capitalize on the opportunity of remote work.</strong></p>
<h3>Work Environment Will Be A Priority</h3>
<p>When working remotely, the work environment can vary from a table in a coffee shop, to a desk in a local library. Or, for some, it can be sitting in pajamas on the living room couch with your trusty cat pawing at your arm.</p>
<p>Josh Johnson, Senior Product Manager at Dribbble, runs a 50-person remote team from a coworking office. His experience with a remote team taught him that work environments aren’t a cookie cutter template, but a functioning part of an employee’s life. If employers can provide employees with the chance to find the optimal work environment, employers become catalyst to their employees’ health, productivity and longevity instead of inhibitors to their potential.</p>
<p><em>“No single way to work is appropriate for everyone. Some people are mentally and emotionally drained by sitting in a bustling, open office environment for nine hours every day. Others feel the same way about sitting alone at a desk in their home. Some people need to get away from their house to focus and be productive, others are happiest when they can take a 2pm conference call and enjoy a quick after school snack with their kids at 3pm.</em></p>
<p><em>We all win when we stop having tweet wars over which way is better and realize that the best possible job market is one that provides diverse opportunities to all types of people in all types of situations.”</em></p>
<p>The future of remote work depends on employers supporting their employees work productivity, no matter what form it takes.</p>
<p>Companies should take an interest in their employees’ remote office. Some are now providing laptops or a desktop computer. Others are giving stipends for home office furniture like standing desks. Even scheduling a weekly grocery delivery order to keep remote employees energized and healthy.</p>
<h3>Lower Overhead than Traditional Office Space</h3>
<p>All businesses are looking to create higher levels of happiness and lower their bottom line. Very rarely has the two ever come in one package, that is until coworking came around. Coworking space memberships often start at only $99 a month for individuals and allows companies to scale their team quickly and efficiently. This includes fast Wifi, utilities, office equipment, cleaning fees, access to networking events, free parking and more. Not to mention the biggest benefit — helping employees not feel so isolated. The overhead of a typical office is upwards of $3,000 not inclusive of all the utilities, maintenance, furniture and taxes. Keeping employees happy? Priceless.</p>
<p>Josh Padnick of Phoenix-based <a href="https://www.gruntwork.io/">Gruntwork</a> employs 14 remote workers and offers coworking as an employee benefit.</p>
<p><em>“We pay for everyone on our team to use a coworking space if they wish, and about half our team uses the benefit. The reality is that working from home all day every day, and then remaining at home at night can be draining and uninteresting. We also crave the in-person human connection and serendipity that comes from being in a physical workplace. Coworking is a great way to provide these things. You get the physical community, and yet your coworkers are distributed.”</em></p>
<p>Josh (full disclosure: he is a member at CO+HOOTS) spends 80% less revenue on office space than a traditional team does. When these savings are redirected to employee health and training, as well as business development, we see why remote teams are able to scale so quickly. Most spaces offer free trials for a day or a week, which give remote employees the opportunity to decide whether to see if being around other highly efficient workers helps them feel more efficient.</p>
<p>Coworking spaces are the done-for-you office space with professional development built in.</p>
<h3>Work Will No Longer Be 9–5</h3>
<p>The idea of the 9–5 work week is becoming less and less popular among employers. We’re finally realizing, <em>it’s not necessary.</em></p>
<p>Richard Branson recently wrote a piece <a href="https://www.virgin.com/richard-branson/way-we-all-work-going-change">on the future of the workplace</a>: “five days a week with two day weekends and a few weeks of holiday each year has become ingrained in society. However, it wasn’t always the case, and it won’t be in the future.”</p>
<p>Virgin happily applies an atypical work week with its employees and allows them to take off two months if they believe they need to.</p>
<p>The typical work schedule is an antiquated idea of how businesses should run. In most cases, there is no need for an employee to come in at a set period. Even more so, it would bode well for their health if they didn’t. Commuting to a job during “rush hour” is becoming increasingly stressful. Missing out on picking kids up for school does not equate to a great work-life balance. We have as a society switched from working hard to working smart and becoming a workforce that values measuring results over measuring time. It makes sense that 9–5 is dead.</p>
<h3>Hire for Diverse Opinions and Cultural Backgrounds</h3>
<p>What if each problem in your business was looked at by three experts with various backgrounds? Instead of getting the same answer three times, you’d have a variant of answers depending on the past experience of your experts.</p>
<p>The location agnostic factor of remote work means each of your experts stands on a different foundation. They all know the same information and can implement the same strategies but they may come to the project with three perspectives, three prior experiences and three ideas on solving any roadblocks along the way.</p>
<p>Diversity of opinions and cultural backgrounds is what Stephen Olmstead, Chief of Staff at <a href="https://www.invisionapp.com/">InVision</a>, attributes to the team’s ability to problem solve.</p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p>Working with 700 people from around the world means that Stephen’s team isn’t built on the foundation of one person’s experience. It’s built on the foundation of 700. Which foundation sounds sturdier?</p>
<p><strong>The future of the workforce is going to consist of happier workers that are location independent and aren’t hindered by their socioeconomic status, gender or race.</strong></p>
<p>Companies will enjoy the benefits reaped when workers aren’t forced to show up to an uninspiring cubicle-laden dungeon with barely any windows after sitting in hours of traffic. They’ll see more innovation by hopping on a Zoom call for a team meeting and seeing the variety of faces on the screen, all with new experiences and ideas from their varying locations of the world.</p>
<p>Companies comprised of an inclusive and diverse workforce that supports happy workers is the future of work we all deserve.</p>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><div>Connor Waslo is a social entrepreneur who is already working on his own startup before starting college. As he takes his proactive steps to ruling the world, we&#8217;re excited to give him hands-on experience with all that goes into building a business. In the words of Connor Waslo (please read in an stellar Australian accent), &#8220;CO+HOOTS has all of that!&#8221; And now we have him to teach us how to wiggle our ears.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>Get our nintern&#8217;s two cents on life before they&#8217;re worth one Bitcoin:</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><b>Hometown: </b>Phoenix, AZ</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><b>Why did you want to work at CO+HOOTS? </b></div>
<div><b> </b>I work best surrounded by social people and lively environments. CO+HOOTS has all of that! As I work on my own startup, I&#8217;ll take any opportunity I can to learn how businesses run and to meet people living my dream. Interning here is basically the perfect opportunity for me to move towards accomplishing all sorts of goals.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><b>What are your hopes and dreams at CO+HOOTS? </b></div>
<div>Fame, fortune, a team of my own interns. Just kidding. I want to meet as many people as I can and absorb as much advice as possible. Capitalizing on such a great learning experience is the ultimate goal.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><b>Members in CO+HOOTS may be able to help you as well… What are your own personal hopes and dreams?</b></div>
<div>I hope to run my own successful startup. Ideally, once I&#8217;ve found my unicorn, I can help other people run their startups as efficiently as possible. Entrepreneurship is such a fantastic skill and someday I want to help kids realize that they don&#8217;t have to work for anybody. They can work for themselves.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><b>If you had 100 billion dollars, you would… </b></div>
<div><b> </b>Invest in education and environmental preservation.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><b>What should the CO+HOOTS community know about you? </b></div>
<div>I love meeting with new people and picking their brain about business, programming, life or anything! I appreciate all sorts of perspectives and would love to meet all of you.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><b>What is one thing people don’t know about you? </b></div>
<div>I&#8217;m not Australian or Russian but I can talk in some pretty decent Australian and Russian accents.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><b>Why are you so awesome? </b></div>
<div>I can wiggle my ears. Hands free. Basically a super power, y&#8217;know? I got offered to be a member of the Avengers but it didn&#8217;t quite fit in my schedule so I had to turn them down.</div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p>Over the past semester, I had the opportunity to intern at CO+HOOTS out of midtown Phoenix. I had never had an internship before with any company, let alone a company so unique, and I was eager for the next months ahead of me. What I gained from my experience was something I would have never expected, and something I would never trade.</p>
<h4>CO+mmunity</h4>
<p>I had never heard of anything like CO+HOOTS before, let alone had the chance to work in such a space. I was intrigued by the idea of coworking in a community that fostered collaboration. It seemed like a mouthful, but I was excited to see just what it meant. From my short time at CO+HOOTS, I was able to learn not only what it meant to be in a community, but also what it means to belong to a community. From brief conversations with members in the kitchen, to getting to know businesses and entrepreneurs within the work space, I learned that there is always someone willing to teach you something if you make the time to learn.</p>
<h4>CO+llaboration</h4>
<p>I have found in other jobs I previously had that not everyone was willing to work or listen to someone new to the workforce that had little relevant experience to offer; this was NOT the case when I came to CO+HOOTS. Immediately, my ideas and opinions were welcomed, and even taken into consideration on projects big and small. My skills were put to use in ways that I wouldn’t have thought of on my own. I was given the chance to collaborate alongside other interns, as well as industry professionals, with the skills and connections made from the networking given to me by CO+HOOTS.</p>
<h4>CO+work &amp; CO+care</h4>
<p>When I came to CO+HOOTS, I was pleasantly surprised by how comfortable I felt from my very first visit. I was welcomed by friendly faces and down-to-earth people that I could connect with on a business and personal level. As a typical college student, I have a lot on my plate and am pretty overwhelmed a majority of the time. When I was having a bad day (okay, bad week), I was able to go to my supervisors and express my frustrations with school, work and just life in general. It felt good knowing that I worked with people that actually cared about my well-being and how I was doing when I was outside the office, too.</p>
<p>From my time at CO+HOOTS, I learned an indescribable amount of life lessons about business, entrepreneurship, networking and what it means to have a friend. As my time at CO+HOOTS comes to a close, I can’t help but think of what fellow intern Bryce Manhardt likes to remind us of from The Lego Movie: “Everything is awesome when you’re part of a team.” Although my time with the team has come to a close, I know I’ll be able to call upon anyone of them whenever I need a helping hand. <!--codes_iframe--></p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p>Amaya Lim is a tech-savvy musician who dreams of funding problem-solving technologies and pursuing a creative future. Meanwhile, you may find her playing DJ while taking a walk on our treadmill desk. We love young entrepreneurs with initiative, and Amaya takes initiative to a whole new level (she&#8217;s in high school and interning with our member <a href="http://distillmill.com">Distill Mill</a> too!). Get to know our nintern before she&#8217;s famous:</p>
<p><strong>Hometown:</strong> Phoenix, Arizona</p>
<p><strong>Why did you want to work at CO+HOOTS?</strong><br /> I know that my personal productivity and creativity are deeply influenced by my environment; the quality of my work is a direct reflection of how stimulating my surroundings are. CO+HOOTS really checks all the boxes for an ideal workspace: strong culture of collaboration, focus on innovation and using technology to improve the world, and, of course, treadmill desks.</p>
<p><strong>What are your hopes and dreams at CO+HOOTS?</strong><br /> I would like to meet as many members as possible and gain a broad understanding of how they each run their businesses. There is no better way to gain entrepreneurial skills than actually being an entrepreneur, and as a student this opportunity is the next best thing. CO+HOOTS is integrating community outreach into an inventive business model, and I am inspired by that focus on the lasting impact a company can have on its environment.</p>
<p><strong>Members in CO+HOOTS may be able to help you as well… What are your own personal hopes and dreams? </strong><br /> As a high school senior, my most immediate goal is to graduate and attend university in the fall of 2018. Right now I’m hoping to be a computer science major and use those skills in the business world. I am also a musician, so I would hope to continue to pursue music and have a career that allows me to incorporate creativity into every day.</p>
<p><strong>If you had 100 billion dollars, you would…</strong><br /> I would first put away enough money for a college education! Then I would probably use the rest to invest in technologies or ideas that might solve some of the world’s biggest problems, but lack funding. For instance, some elite science fair projects actually have the power to make clean water or produce clean energy, and with a billion dollars I could help to bring those innovations to the communities that need them most.</p>
<p><strong>What should the CO+HOOTS community know about you? </strong><br /> I like learning new things about people—their work, background, interests, passions, favorite kind of cookie. I have this pretty intense resting face that looks a little angry, and it’s something that I’m working on, but know that in the meanwhile it is not a reflection of my disposition, which is actually quite sunny! Also, there’s a good chance I like the music that you listen to, and would love to hear any and all recommendations.</p>
<p><strong>What is one thing people don’t know about you? </strong><br /> I love making playlists, and I can DJ any mood at any time. Give me the aux cord and I will give you a party.</p>
<p><strong>Why are you so awesome?</strong><br /> I really am quite excited about working at CO+HOOTS, which I hope translates into my interactions with members. I’m really interested in all aspects of the space and its operations, and I will do my best to learn as much as I can through this incredible opportunity. <!--codes_iframe--></p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p>Skylar Patterson is a proponent of sustainability and a supporter of community success. While we don&#8217;t really believe his claims to be a mobster in his past life, we won&#8217;t question it. His passions for tackling social issues and marketing are made to kick ass, and we don&#8217;t need a mobster spirit helping him kick ours, too. Learn more about Sky as he builds his strategic mindset as a CO+HOOTS nintern:</p>
<p><strong>Hometown: </strong>Born and Raised in the East Bay, CA!</p>
<p><strong>Why did you want to work at CO+HOOTS?</strong><br /> I love entrepreneurship and wanted to work with like-minded people. Also wanted to gain more hands on experience in marketing and content strategy. Plus I love everything CO+HOOTS stands for and would like to see these guys grow and inevitably take over the world.</p>
<p><strong>What are your hopes and dreams at CO+HOOTS?</strong><br /> To make new friends and help CO+HOOTS grow in every way that I can.</p>
<p><strong>Members in CO+HOOTS may be able to help you as well… What are your own personal hopes and dreams?</strong><br /> I&#8217;m turning a life-long interest in marketing/psychology into a career and would love to gain any/all insight into the industry from others who work in marketing. I&#8217;d like to absorb as much information as I can while I am here.</p>
<p>On another note, I would like to build a cabin in the woods and live a sustainable life – top millennial cliché, I know – but difference being I follow through on the promises I make.<br /> <strong> </strong><br /> <strong>If you had 100 billion dollars, you would…</strong><br /> I&#8217;m pretty boring when it comes to this stuff because I tend to be pretty frugal &#8211; but for starters I would put 500k aside to put my son, brother and sister through school. Then take 25B and put it in a trust to be given to my son when he turns 25. I&#8217;d then buy a few acres in Flagstaff and build a cabin designed to use every square inch as efficiently as possible.</p>
<p>Once those two things were out of the way, I&#8217;d start developing a Tiny House community in Tempe that would act as a blueprint for future communities that I&#8217;d roll out nationally.</p>
<p>I’d then buy out all of the slaughterhouses, egg facilities, fish farms and commercial fishing boats in the world and shut them down – it is 100 billion dollars after all.</p>
<p>If anything was left over, I’d invest in solar, wind, tidal and geothermal energy to help get us off fossil fuel as a main source of energy.</p>
<p><strong>What should the CO+HOOTS community know about you?</strong><br /> I’m eager to learn and I’m very passionate about what I do. I tend to get obsessive about the projects I take on but I feel that it acts as an asset.</p>
<p>Some general facts about me: I’ve been Vegan for three years, married for one. I have a 1-year-old son (Theo), lived in Austin for two years and ran a food/tea truck, and am currently going to school for marketing. When I’m not at CO+HOOTS or spending time with my family, I can usually be found reading (a lot), writing on social issues, hiking, camping or working on some random new project.</p>
<p><strong>What is one thing people don’t know about you? </strong><br /> I was a notorious mobster in a past life. This used to be unspoken information but I feel comfortable sharing it with you. You can keep a secret right?</p>
<p><strong>Why are you so awesome? </strong><br /> I’m glad you brought this up because I feel like it’s a question that’s on everyone’s mind. Seriously though, if someone feels that I’m awesome it is probably because I want others to succeed. I’ve noticed that people are at their best when they are around people who build them up – not break them down. I love hearing about people’s dreams – but what I love even more is seeing them take steps towards achieving those dreams. That’s probably why I reached out to CO+HOOTS in the first place. <!--codes_iframe--></p></div>

Channeling her elbow-licking powers at CO+HOOTS. We know Julia&#8217;s collaborative personality and curiosity will make her a force to reckon with. Get to know our new nintern as she takes the world by storm:</p>
<p><strong>Hometown: </strong>Prescott Valley, AZ!</p>
<p><strong>Why did you want to work at CO+HOOTS? </strong>I want the opportunity to work, network, and collaborate with like-minded and motivated individuals!</p>
<p><strong>What are your hopes and dreams at CO+HOOTS? </strong>My hopes and dreams at CO+HOOTS are to learn as much as I can in as many areas as I can!</p>
<p><strong>Members in CO+HOOTS may be able to help you as well… What are your own personal hopes and dreams? </strong>My personal dreams are to change the world through the power of human kindness. I dream of a world where everyone is inspired to love and get along for the betterment of mankind. Slightly cliché, I know, but sometimes that’s the best part about dreams. They’re allowed to be anything you want.</p>
<p><strong>If you had 100 billion dollars, you would… </strong>If I had 100 billion dollars I would set up saving accounts for all my nieces and nephews, as well as any potential future children, set money aside to finishing school, indulge in a shopping spree, then go to work combating the issues limiting the world to clean water and food.</p>
<p><strong>What should the CO+HOOTS community know about you? </strong>The CO+HOOTS community should know I am very curious, if I don’t know about something I want to be taught and never belittled.</p>
<p><strong>What is one thing people don’t know about you? </strong>One thing not many people know about me is I have the back of my neck pierced!</p>
<p><strong>Why are you so awesome? </strong>I think I am so awesome because I can lick my elbow, which is the core of all my powers. <!--codes_iframe--></p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p>Bryce Manhardt is a rock star who believes in bettering the world around him. Of course, that doesn&#8217;t stop him from writing killer fiction about dystopian futures to get in the zone. With a love for business, community and leading us away from the apocalypse, Bryce is truly a serial entrepreneur in the making — and we&#8217;re lucky enough to be part of the making! Get to know Bryce as he leaves his imprint on CO+HOOTS:</p>
<p><strong>Why did you want to work at CO+HOOTS? </strong>I want to work at CO+HOOTS because I love the community aspect of business, and I truly believe that CO+HOOTS is making holistic improvements on the community and individuals it effects!</p>
<p><strong>What are your hopes and dreams at CO+HOOTS? </strong>I hope to improve upon the CO+HOOTS business process in some way. I hope to meet many driven and passionate people, and gain exposure to entrepreneurial world.</p>
<p><strong>Members in CO+HOOTS may be able to help you as well… What are your own personal hopes and dreams? </strong>It is my personal dream to be a serial entrepreneur, and to create (a) business(es) that make an improvement on the lives of some group of people, large or small.</p>
<p><strong>If you had 100 billion dollars, you would… </strong>If I had 100 billion dollars I would (apart from donating) invest a good portion into Bitcoin! Its an electronic exchange system that could end up democratizing banking like the internet did for information!</p>
<p><strong>What should the CO+HOOTS community know about you? </strong>CO+HOOTS should know that I want to hear whatever you are working on, if you ever want to share. I love to hear what makes people passionate and the big ideas that they have cooking.</p>
<p><strong>What is one thing people don’t know about you? </strong>One thing people don&#8217;t know about me is that I love writing descriptive fiction about possible utopian/dystopian futures! It gets me to think more thoroughly when I am not completely focused.</p>
<p><strong>Why are you so awesome? </strong>I am awesome because I love learning about basically everything! It gets me excited to know more about the world! <!--codes_iframe--></p></div>
