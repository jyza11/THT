<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve ever looked up how to get smarter (haven’t we all?), reading more is probably on your to-do list. After all, some of the most successful people around make books a staple in their lives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just to name a few: Warren Buffett reads at least </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/27/warren-buffetts-key-tip-for-success-read-500-pages-a-day.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">500 pages per day</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Mark Cuban reads four to </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/31/what-mark-cuban-reads-every-day.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">five hours daily</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Oprah Winfrey and Reese Witherspoon both built massive followings from their monthly book clubs alone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But when your goal is to hone your entrepreneurial skills, how do you know what business books to read? Blindly picking “Twilight” off the shelf probably won’t help you much.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve put together a list of modern business book recommendations that you can put on your reading list to maximize your professional growth. Whether you’re a business owner, freelancer or just an entrepreneurial spirit, these picks can help you diversify your knowledge and apply it into your day-to-day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t worry — there’s no young adult fiction or $200 textbooks here.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why read business books?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Excellent reading habits may be a characteristic shared by many of the world’s top entrepreneurs, but correlation doesn’t imply causation, right? It makes sense to be a little skeptical when your time is on the line.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the positive effects of reading have been proven time and time again. Not only does it increase your vocabulary and make you seem like the most intelligent person on the block, but it </span><a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/what-does-reading-do-to-your-brain-these-5-effects-are-pretty-astounding-74676"><span style="font-weight: 400;">boosts your memory</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and learning capacity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you’re reading about business specifically, you’re filling up that learning capacity with knowledge that really matters. This knowledge can then be applied directly into your operations, strategies and much more.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Three best business books for strategy-building</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The heart of your company is business strategy. When you’re building your master plan, you need to take as much of the guesswork out of the equation as possible. These three books will do the trick:</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. “Traction: Get a Grip on Your Business”</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Traction: Get a Grip on Your Business” by Gino Wickman is one of </span><a href="https://cohoots.com/about/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">our founders</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">’ go-to guides for making decisions or evaluating any approach.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This business book offers a practical system for strengthening the most important parts of your organization, including your vision, data and team. The result is greater efficiency and less stress.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best part is, the book is interactive, so you’ll have actual action items to take away.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Traction-Get-Grip-Your-Business/dp/1936661837"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get the book here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. “The End of Competitive Advantage: How to Keep Your Strategy Moving as Fast as Your Business”</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Written by strategy expert Rita Gunther McGrath, this is the business book to read if you want to make sure your approach is fit for the modern world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The End of Competitive Advantage” acknowledges that change is happening quicker than ever — in every industry — and teaches you how to be quick on your feet. Instead of giving you one surefire path, this book will get you an evergreen mindset that will help you constantly adapt your business strategy.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/End-Competitive-Advantage-Strategy-Business/dp/1422172813"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get the book here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. “The Startup Handbook: Your Step-By-Step, Straight-Talking Guide To Building A Great Business In Your Life”</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many startups don’t make it past their first year. Even if you’ve joined a coworking space — which can make you </span><a href="https://www.business.com/articles/5-things-to-consider-when-looking-for-a-coworking-space/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">four times more likely to succeed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — you’ll encounter many hurdles as you go. But Morris Grant knows that all hurdles can be overcome with a solid business plan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In “The Startup Handbook,” Grant walks you through realistic business tips, ways to stay motivated and many mistakes that you can easily avoid.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Startup-Handbook-Step-Step-Straight-Talking-ebook/dp/B01FWDFV44"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get the book here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two best business books for people management</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A business can’t run itself — it needs people. But you and your team can only be at your best if you can continue to stay motivated and grow together. These are the two business books to read when you want to maximize your team’s every effort:</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. “Radical Candor: Be a Kick-Ass Boss Without Losing Your Humanity”</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Far too many business book lists fail to include voices from </span><a href="https://cohoots.com/2019/03/26/lessons-from-women-in-leadership/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">women in leadership</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which is a shame because they’re all missing out on Kim Scott’s guide on being an empathetic leader.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Radical Candor” is all about building a culture of feedback that lifts your team up without knocking anyone down. This book will help you nurture your relationships within your organization, so you can move forward at the same pace.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Radical-Candor-Kim-Scott/dp/B01KTIEFEE"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get the book here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. “Managing Oneself: The Key to Success”</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes, it’s not managing other people you need to worry about — it’s managing yourself. Peter F. Drucker, who is known as the father of modern management, helps you stay accountable and lead by example.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Managing Oneself” is a short, practical guide for anyone who wants to become a better CEO for themselves or for their teams.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Managing-Oneself-Peter-F-Drucker/dp/163369304X"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get the book here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two best business books for boosting ROI</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So you have your overarching strategy down and your team running at max efficiency. The next step is making sure you understand how to stand out in your market to continuously profit more. These two business books can help:</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. “Blue Ocean Strategy: How to Create Uncontested Market Space and Make the Competition Irrelevant”</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Blue Ocean Strategy” has been a massive hit since its 2015 release for good reason. In the book, W. Chan Kim and Renée Mauborgne give you actionable tips to escape the world of cutthroat competition and captivate your own unique audience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kim and Mauborgne explain how you can create ‘blue oceans’ (or new market spaces) that help you become the one and only choice for your customers.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blue-Ocean-Strategy-Expanded-Uncontested/dp/1625274491"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get the book here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. “Purple Cow: Transform Your Business by Being Remarkable”</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seth Godin is known as a modern entrepreneurship master and his marketing classic shows you how to become a master, too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Purple Cow” shows you how to make your product or service more marketable and how to easily differentiate yourself. This book offers plenty of straightforward tips, paired with real-world examples, that any business owner can implement.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Expanding your knowledge will make you the business leader you want to be. With our recommendations, you’ll have enjoyable business books to read that help you further your career without making your brain hurt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Start gathering these incredible reads from (preferably) your local bookstore, Amazon or your local library to get yourself into a growth mindset and maybe become the next Warren Buffett.</span></p>
