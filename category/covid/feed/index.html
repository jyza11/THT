Read Part 2 <a href="https://cohoots.com/2020/04/10/businesses-tactics-in-a-covid19-world-part-2-generating-revenue/">here.</a> </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /> <i>If you’re stuck, reach out. CO+HOOTS is hosting weekly financial/legal information sessions to support personalized guidance during this time. We are here for you. Learn more here: </i><a href="http://bit.ly/eventsatco"><i>bit.ly/eventsatco</i></a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8212;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of us have felt a little useless as we’ve holed up in our homes. As our first responders and medical professionals help those infected, what can the rest of us do after we’re done binging Netflix and eating our fourth round of takeout? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I begin thinking about America, post-COVID, I am excited about all that needs to be done for our cities. Yes, things look and likely will be dire. That also means there is opportunity to start anew in what will be a different economic landscape. I think my fellow entrepreneurial friends who survived the last recession are starting to feel this itch too — the landscape is ripe for rebuilding and it is our job to do it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nothing brings us together like a common enemy. And that enemy is not human, it’s COVID-19. There are a few things you can do to start contributing to the rebuilding of our economy, I encourage you to first think about strengthening yourself. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Self-Care</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a person who is a quick starter but is constantly anxious, I take time to center myself by continuously reinvesting in myself. To be ready for what’s to come, you need to have the right mindset and have the correct knowledge and skills; or at least a basic understanding of what will be needed. Here are some ideas to tackle this type of Self-Care:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t forget to take a break and step outside. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone is struggling with anxiety and fear right now, don’t forget to check in with others and there are free therapists to talk to. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try meditation: I love the </span><a href="http://breathepeople.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Breathe People app</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (also can be found on spotify). </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you thought technology is important for business, this new post-COVID-19 world has upped the technology ante. </span><a href="https://www.promineotech.com/scholarship"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Promineo Tech</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://dash.generalassemb.ly/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">General Assembly </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">are launching scholarships for coding bootcamps for individuals who want to begin upskilling to a new industry.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our own LevelUp Incubator at CO+HOOTS is offering </span><a href="http://cohoots.com/levelup"><span style="font-weight: 400;">free access to the next Rapid Launch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> program to help newly unemployed individuals build their side hustle business. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></h2>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Future</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If we start working now, we can structure a future that makes sense for so many more people. If we, as rebuilders, had the opportunity to create a version of the world that worked better, what would it look like? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Would retail/restaurants have more reasons to begin building businesses that live beyond physical walls, while also finding solutions to somehow create the experience people still crave from your establishments? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Would educators develop new education models that serve all learning styles while giving our teachers more support resources to nurture tomorrow’s innovators?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Would our leaders of consultancies redefine what and how our work is done? Pass a national standard for maternity leave or minimum wage?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Would startups develop a business model that isn’t only defined by back-breaking growth or IPOs, but by impact, which in turn, will still positively affect your bottom line?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Would housing be built to support all income levels?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Can we elect officials without them selling their values to the highest bidder?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For entrepreneur support organizations like mine at CO+HOOTS, can we challenge the existing model of entrepreneurship by making it possible for more people to own and thrive in business?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It takes courage to take action when the whole world seems to be falling apart. But if there is ever a time to fake courage, it is now. </span></p>

Read Part 1 <a href="https://cohoots.com/2020/04/10/businesses-tactics-in-a-covid19-world-part-1-of-3/">here</a>.</span></i></p>

<p>&#8212;-</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The trick to effectively pivoting your business to generate new income still comes down to the basics &#8212; knowing your customer market and what they need. Restaurants and service-based businesses that used technology to build their online business or successfully streamlined operations before the mandated shutdown have bought themselves a few additional months of survival.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In times of crisis, needs shift regularly so never stop listening and gathering information. Most people are wary of spending right now, so how can you utilize your time to build trust until customers are ready? Or is there something else that customers need right now versus what you’re selling? Or do they need what you’re selling, but need to buy and receive it differently than how it’s being done now?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So what does that all look like? Here are some ideas, which may lead you to realize how you could be running much leaner with more margins. </span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Start a prepay program if you know you can deliver services/products later. Some restaurants are marketing discounted catering packages that can be used at a later date. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be honest with the help you need. Five years ago, a local paper shutdown without notice and hundreds of people said they would have chipped in to support the paper if it had just let people know HOW they needed help. Your customers can help you figure out new models. Be open to feedback. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider new ways to sell. Do you have products or services that could be easily sold differently? For example, law firms are shifting from hourly rates to packaged rates to help businesses negotiate their leases. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead of losing a customer altogether because of the crisis, consider a temporary discounted rate. Gusto, a payroll company, has offered to defer fees by three months, knowing that many companies may have to layoff their employees. With the discount, Gusto hopes to retain those companies as customers. but if they can retain customers, it’s better than losing them.  </span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After two weeks of operating a delivery-only business for their restaurant in Minneapolis, my parents have seen a large uptick in sales. Their revenue is not as high as it was before, but this new process has made operations easier for a couple in their 70s. They are now seriously considering permanently shifting their business model to takeout only. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t Count on Customers Only</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortunately, business-to-business companies are jumping in to help those who are still looking to improve their sales and operations. Almost all the food delivery networks (Uber Eats, Grubhub, DoorDash) are waiving their fees to help their restaurant partners generate more revenue during the COVID-19 outbreak. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can check other discounts and business tool freebies here: </span></p>
<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1q5hDjGi4eGF9eM694DyJoSLf_3elxQy3U8bgTYXNe4M/mobilebasic"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1q5hDjGi4eGF9eM694DyJoSLf_3elxQy3U8bgTYXNe4M/mobilebasic</span></a></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Local communities are also launching campaigns to further support local businesses. The Arizona Restaurant Association has launched Take Out Week (</span><a href="https://arizonarestaurantweek.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://arizonarestaurantweek.com/</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). The Arizona Asian Chamber of Commerce has also started a campaign to support Asian run businesses called #takeoutthursday. Restaurants can promote these types of local events to bring in more orders. You may want to check your local business associations/coalitions to see what groups are coming together to support mainstreet businesses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The federal government’s massive CARE stimulus bill is a huge parachute to many small businesses impacted by COVID. Beyond the $1,200 stimulus check that will be coming to anyone who makes under $75k/year, there are two loan products for small businesses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Payroll Protection Program (PPP) loan is forgivable if companies maintain payroll, comes with a </span><b>fixed 1% interest rate </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">and has a loan cap of 2.5x your monthly payroll costs with a </span><b>2-year</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> term. The second loan option is the Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDJ) loan, which has </span><b>a 3.75% interest </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">rate and allows for a loan amount of up to $2 million over a 30-year term. But this loan is not forgivable</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lot of organizations have launched grant programs to help small businesses during COVID. Local First Arizona has started a micro-grant program (</span><a href="https://www.localfirstaz.com/small-business-relief-fund"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.localfirstaz.com/small-business-relief-fund</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) and the state has a list of resources that small businesses can apply for. (</span><a href="https://www.azcommerce.com/covid-19/business-financial-support/?fbclid=IwAR1B1I5djG_MuiVhebZGLtOrcFXwLA16Sm7yvvfiw4t_cGKUBSq8WMB0r30"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.azcommerce.com/&#8230;/business-financial-support/</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). Again check your own local community to find additional support. </span></p>

<p>&#8212;-</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thirty-eight years ago, my parents opened Camdi Restaurant, a small Chinese-Vietnamese restaurant named after my mom in downtown Minneapolis. It has been open consistently until two weeks ago when, for the first time ever, the restaurant was mandated to close dine-in service. My parents have since lost nearly 75% of their income. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I caught up with my mom that evening, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I realized there is so much she should be doing. But no one is guiding her as a small restaurant owner. Add on language barriers and not used to asking for help (a cultural trait), her challenges are compounding.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I asked if she has requested help from her utility company, or from the banks that carry any of the loans she had. “No,” she said, “I don’t even know how I would start doing that. Can I do that?” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The story is similar to many other small business owners I’ve chatted with over the last week. The panic is real and, unfortunately, government support is still several weeks out. I fear we are facing the mass decimation of our main street businesses if we don’t help them make changes now, especially those from underrepresented communities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am not a financial expert or legal advisor, but I founded a coworking/incubator space called CO+HOOTS in the middle of the last recession and have supported nearly a thousand entrepreneurs over the last decade, of those businesses 80% survived the last recession and have grown and thrived. While not comprehensive to all businesses, I hope the following steps can be helpful to many mainstreet businesses who may be paralyzed, questioning if they need to prepare to close their doors and just walk away or hang in a little longer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An overwhelming weight of uncertainty hangs over us all, myself included, but there are steps to weather this storm and potentially even benefit from it. Together, my mom and I worked on the tactical steps she could implement immediately to buy her some time until the government’s stimulus package rolls out or until she could work out a new revenue model. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We talked through her highest expense items and identified next steps to lower her burn rate. You can find the worksheet we quickly put together in the link below. If you’re like mom, you also needed some guidance on how to negotiate with partners. With the help of Amber Cordoba, manager of consulting services for Chicanos Por La Causa, the following script was developed to help small businesses with beginning the discussions. Feel free to take, edit and revise for your needs. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hello [NAME], As you may know, my business [BIZ NAME] was mandated to close due to COVID-19. This has caused an incredible loss of business resulting in financial hardship in a very short amount of time. We’ve seen an xx% loss of revenue since [DATE] and are doing everything we can to maintain operations and mitigate costs. I’m reaching out to see if [COMPANY/NAME] has any ability to help me in this difficult time. I can likely [INSERT OFFER/ASK — Could be 50% reduction, a 2-3 month deferral, interest only payments, to cancel a subscription, revenue share, or just ask for help and let them respond]. This would allow us to keep employees paid until we can pivot to new revenue strategies. Thank you in advance.</span></i></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">PART 1: Mitigate costs</span></h2>
<p><b>(Estimated time to complete: 1 hour)</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Begin by listing all your expenses and addressing what areas can be negotiated down, waived or canceled. Now is the time to get lean. If you’re lean already, get leaner. You want to be the ground beef that is only 2% fat (which is ironically more expensive).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. List all your business expenses. It might be easiest to start with your biggest expenses first. (Here is a simple spreadsheet to start filling in if you need help: <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1z7HQhSMIVpe3LT7wW1FaUUySaJT2FH9ErVZrmszIzy4/edit?usp=sharing). ">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1z7HQhSMIVpe3LT7wW1FaUUySaJT2FH9ErVZrmszIzy4/edit?usp=sharing). </a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="wp-image-238718 alignnone size-full" src="https://cohoots.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-10-at-10.53.10-AM.png" alt="" width="1534" height="286" srcset="https://cohoots.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-10-at-10.53.10-AM.png 1534w, https://cohoots.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-10-at-10.53.10-AM-1280x239.png 1280w, https://cohoots.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-10-at-10.53.10-AM-980x183.png 980w, https://cohoots.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-10-at-10.53.10-AM-480x89.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) and (max-width: 1280px) 1280px, (min-width: 1281px) 1534px, 100vw" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Main columns: Category, Monthly Cost, Action, Notes. Your “Actions” should be either: Freeze/Pause, Renegotiate, Cancel, or Keep.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Once you’ve documented your expenses, prioritize your most expensive costs (you should sort the columns now). Begin your emails, calls, outreach to these vendors to lower or eliminate costs. Track these in the “Action” column. </span></p>
<p><b>Pro Tip:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> You can negotiate everything. Are you renting or paying utilities to your city municipality? City of Tempe has done a great job of quickly finding ways to support small businesses like abating all rent on property they own.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Staff, this is a tough one. No one wants to let staff go, but if you don’t have customers, you can’t sustain staff. </span></p>
<p><b>Pro Tip: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pay payroll tax first, this tax comes with the highest fees if you miss it. </span></p>
<p><b>Note: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The federal government’s new stimulus package includes small business loans that can be forgiven if you keep your staff on payroll through June, keep watching the news as information is being released daily. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Check if your vendors and partner costs can be lowered. Are you paying for software or services you won’t be using through this crisis? (Ex. do you pay a monthly fee for banking or payroll?)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">5. Map the projected new expenses against the projected new revenue (for my parents, they suddenly saw a drop of 75% of their revenue) and see if you get in the black. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do this again for your personal expenses. (Student loans? Car payments? Home loans? Utility bills? Internet bills?) Reducing your personal expenses will help you also stay afloat. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lastly, as you begin negotiating or canceling with vendors, partners and staff, realize everyone is struggling. Your hope is to get leeway where you can from people who can give you that. Realize not everyone can. Patience and empathy are required from all right now if we are to get through this together.</span></p>
