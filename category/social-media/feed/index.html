It’s also a massive digital community where all of your potential leads, </span><a href="https://cohoots.com/advisors/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">advisors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, investors and collaborators may be just a message away. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you prioritize social networking for business, in addition to building relationships at your </span><a href="https://cohoots.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">local coworking space</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you create more connections that guarantee your long-term growth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This article will give you clear guidance on why social networking matters and how you can use it to gain the competitive advantage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why social networking matters</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As social media increasingly becomes a digital </span><a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2016/09/14/third-places-as-community-builders/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">third place</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, its power has become impossible to ignore. Online interactions are no longer a separate world — they’re directly influencing real-life connections, both personal and professional.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, </span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2016/06/22/social-media-and-the-workplace/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">less than a quarter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of professionals are creating or strengthening business relationships through social media. This huge gap represents your opportunity to take the lead.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With </span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/fact-sheet/social-media/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">over 70% of all U.S. adults</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> maintaining at least one social media profile — and the number only rising as younger generations enter adulthood and the workforce — the time is now to use this digital space for professional networking.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">5 social networking tips for business leaders</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As is the case when you do anything in business, you don’t want to leave strategy behind when you start leveraging social media for your career growth. Use these five tips when social networking for business to maximize your time and ensure your efforts don’t go to waste:</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Build your brand first</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you’re reaching out to and engaging with other users and businesses on social media, they should get a clear picture of who you are upon visiting your page. Make sure everything from your bio to your content matches who you want to be perceived as professionally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The more consistent you are across all platforms — this may include using the same handle, using matching profile pictures and posting with the same frequency — the stronger your brand will be.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Online attention spans are extremely short, so it’s important that visitors can recognize what you do and remember who you are after a quick skim of your profile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re an established entrepreneur and want to further enhance your brand on social media, you may consider </span><a href="https://www.thebalancesmb.com/how-to-develop-your-brand-strategy-2295187"><span style="font-weight: 400;">developing a brand strategy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for yourself. This will help you define who you are, communicate your message clearly and speak to the right audience. Your strategy will also help you create guidelines for your voice and visuals.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Prioritize the right channels</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not every channel is equally suited for professional networking in your specific industry. Just because LinkedIn is designed to help anyone network doesn’t mean your specific audience is there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have a game plan for what types of professionals you want to reach out to — list out specific people if you have anyone in mind — and figure out what platforms they’re using. Use advanced search tools on LinkedIn, Facebook and Twitter to narrow down your searches faster.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, keep in mind that just because someone’s on a channel doesn’t mean it’s the right place to network with them. If someone is clearly using their Instagram page just to post dog and baby pictures, they’re probably not looking for professional connections on the app.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Join professional groups</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facebook Groups can be your go-to resource when you want to make new virtual connections, need support or give back to your peers. These virtual groups are mini communities of their own that instantly give you something in common with other members.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To find some local business groups or worldwide industry-based groups, search by keywords like “Arizona business” or “marketing” and join (or request to join) groups that sound interesting and helpful. You can always leave if they turn out to be poorly moderated, with too much spam or too many distractions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though not as plentiful, you can also search for groups on LinkedIn for more formal networking.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Personalize your pitch</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On social media, where authenticity rules, others can see right through you if you’re not genuine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A first rule of thumb is to never directly copy, paste and send your messages to every single person you reach out to. Whether you’re reaching out on LinkedIn, Twitter, or somewhere else, your recipient is unlikely to respond if you don’t show why you’re reaching out to them specifically.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your pitch should also be unique from any email-based pitches you send out. Even when you’re social networking for business, social media tends to be a more personable platform where your “best regards” probably aren’t the best way to close out a message.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">5. Offer value first</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People don’t buy products and services. They buy the value the products and services provide.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similarly, your pitch will be most effective if you create value before you try to sell. While salesy messages can easily be ignored, messages that offer a </span><a href="https://cohoots.com/speaker-series/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">helpful resource</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a free trial or even a call to simply connect will usually get you at least one response.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lasting professional relationships — which are more valuable than one-time sales — can only begin if there’s mutual benefit and a human connection.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Master virtual networking</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social media makes it possible for professionals to connect anytime, from just about anywhere. Even if you live in the middle of nowhere or there are no networking events in your area, there’s no excuse not to start social networking for business — as long as you have WiFi, that is.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you’ve built up your virtual network, you may start planning some in-person collaborations soon. When you’re ready to take your professional relationships offline, </span><a href="https://cohoots.com/meeting-rooms-event-space/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">grab a meeting room in a creative space</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to inspire your strongest ideas.</span></p></div>
