				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At CO+HOOTS, inclusion forms the core of who we are. Many of our member companies and members share that foundational value. One of those is Melanie Isaacs, who founded social enterprise Pal Experiences to create digital tools to help service providers become more inclusive for families with autism and other special abilities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since its founding in 2012, Pal Experiences has positively changed the experiences for these families at several public and private spaces. Pal Experiences has not only made its partner organizations more aware of the issue but also helped change their processes to accommodate these families like never before.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because of Melanie’s landscape-changing work, Pal Experiences was recently named Grant Thornton LLP’s 2020 “Purple Paladin,” a prestigious national prize and award that supports nonprofits that tackle real issues and provides them a nationwide platform to support their mission. Currently, there are only three Purple Paladin awards that are being endorsed by Grant Thornton. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pal Experiences is the first nonprofit from Arizona to be named a Purple Paladin. This program includes $10,000 in funding, the production of a spotlight video, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">an awareness campaign including a press release and social posts, an internal staff fundraiser for Pal Experiences and consulting. Pal Experiences will have a team of Grant Thornton employees to assist with business planning, strategy and volunteering. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the support of Grant Thornton, Melanie is able to expand her mission on a national level. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are a small non-profit with a small voice, and the most important thing to us is to get the word out there that we have these tools, and that it is important,” Melanie said. “By selecting us to be a Purple Paladin, Grant Thornton has given us a mountain to shout from, and mountains are incredibly helpful for startups.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grant Thornton LLP, founded in 1924, is the U.S. member firm of Grant Thornton International Ltd; and one of the world’s leading organizations in independent audit, tax, and advisory firms. Its Purple Paladin program is an initiative that helps emerging organizations with a social impact. Its website states, “Real heroes don’t wear shining armor. They are everyday people who take on real issues.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Dec. 12, 2019, Laura Elits, Grant Thornton’s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Corporate Social Responsibility Leader,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reached out to Melanie on LinkedIn regarding Pal Experiences. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“She said she found us online and was eager to learn more </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">I filled out an application, had a phone interview, and the last step of the process was a meeting with the CEO, Brad Preber,” Melanie explained.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grant Thornton is a huge sponsor of the PGA, and the executive team was at the Waste Management Phoenix Open golf tournament. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My meeting was set up the morning of the tournament,” Melanie said. “I brought a presentation and dressed in a blazer. I was told my meeting would happen after the CEO welcomed the Grant Thornton employees. Instead, he called me up and announced we had won! I was completely, totally surprised! It was amazing.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brad Preber said in a press release that Pal Experiences was the ideal Purple Paladin, “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They already have many partner organizations serving as ‘Pal Places’ — and Grant Thornton hopes to help them add more across the nation, while also helping them increase their use of technology to improve their services.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Melanie never had a plan to create a nonprofit or social enterprise; until a chance encounter while she was working toward a masters in marine biology at Western Illinois University. One day on a train ride back from the aquarium where she worked, she happened upon a boy who was really excited about the aquarium staff t-shirt she was wearing. After answering all of his questions about the aquarium, she asked the family if they would like to visit there one day, but the family surprisingly and promptly replied, “No.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The parents explained that their son had autism, which made it nearly impossible for him to truly enjoy the experience. Visiting such a public space would be too overwhelming for him, something he could never do. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Struck by this story, Melanie started her journey to redefine the meaning of inclusivity.  She realized that most of the public spaces were accessible for families with some disabilities through the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), but very few spaces were set up for families with members who are autistic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the United States, 1 in 6 children have a developmental disability and nearly 70% of all families with children on the Autism spectrum experience social isolation. Not being able to ever go to the movies, a theme park or the aquarium, are situations unimaginable for many of these families. With the founding of Pal Experiences, Melanie has made it her mission to help those families successfully engage in activities within their communities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pal Experiences offer technology-based learning tools to help families prepare to visit a public space. Video materials and picture-based feedback tools help Pal Experiences’ partners optimize their tools to provide an amazing experience for all families. Created with a true passion to improve accessibility for all, Pal Experiences has partnered with companies such as the world-renowned Musical Instrument Museum to improve visits for guests of all abilities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We believe that it can be socially and economically transformative for a diverse spectrum of people to participate in the activities many of us take for granted.” Melanie said.</span></p>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><em>“Power is not given to you. You have to take it.”</em> -Beyonce</p>
<p>The topic of women in leadership has never trended harder in human history. With the digital age came an influx of information that started to shed light on major cultural problems. Data is widely spread and it has become household knowledge that the dream of equality isn’t nearly as close as we hoped. It’s opened the door for new conversations.</p>
<p>You can find several articles that tackle gender inequality of leadership positions in business. This article is different. Instead, I’m going to focus on the lessons women already in leadership have provided and can provide to other women who are just starting their career. Let’s leverage everything we have today to accelerate what we want to accomplish as women in business.</p>
<p><strong>These are the five must-know lessons from women in leadership about becoming a leader.</strong></p>
<h3>Master Your Internal Dialogue — be true to yourself as you would with a friend</h3>
<p>Arianna Huffington is one of the founders of The Huffington Post, which sold to AOL in 2011 for $315 million dollars.</p>
<p>During her rise to the top, she discovered a major difference between herself and her male counterparts. This difference can be seen in researched evidence that women may internalize stress more than men.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Women in stressful jobs have a 40 percent greater risk of heart disease, and a 60 percent greater risk of diabetes. We internalize stress. We need to change that.</p>
<p>We need to stop listening to that voice that I call the obnoxious roommate in our head, that judges us and doesn’t think we’re doing everything perfectly, so that we can be a little easier on ourselves. That will help us deal with stress better.” (<a href="https://www.chase.com/news/020818-leadership-lessons-women">Source</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How can women, and men, avoid causing themselves stress from the internal dialogue that runs through their mind?</p>
<p><strong>By asking themselves one question: Would I talk to my friend the way that I talk to myself?</strong></p>
<p>As Arianna points out, our internal dialogue can be detrimental to our personal health and professional development. <em>Elevate yourself, don’t bully yourself.</em></p>
<h3>You can’t be what you can’t see — seek out the female leaders in your community</h3>
<p>Dona Sarkar is the Head of the Windows Insider Program. She is one of the most influential members of the Windows team, yet she never imagined she’d be able to reach such a massive milestone in her career.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“When I was growing up in Detroit, if someone had told me, ‘Hey Dona, you’re going to be making a really, really great salary working at Microsoft as a very senior person,’ I would have just hysterically laughed.” (<a href="https://medium.com/thrive-global/dream-it-do-it-own-it-confidence-coaches-cd4a6235530">Source</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dona attributes laughing at the thought of such success to her lack of female mentorship. When she was growing up, she didn’t see any women in high leadership positions and so, she didn’t imagine that she had the potential within herself to pull it off.</p>
<p>Suelin Chen, a PhD graduate from MIT in Materials Science and Engineering and former executive at the Lab@Hardvard says, “<em>You have to see it to be it</em>.”</p>
<p><strong>Where can you see more women in leadership positions?</strong></p>
<p>-Online Interviews (Youtube Videos, Podcasts, etc.)</p>
<p>-Conferences and Meetups (<a href="https://www.ellevatenetwork.com/">Ellevate Network</a>, <a href="http://girlsintech.com/">Girls in Tech</a>, etc.)</p>
<p>-Mentorship Programs (For example, <a href="https://www.millionwomenmentors.com/">Million Women Mentors</a> or <a href="https://elpha.com/">Elpha via Y-Combinator</a>)</p>
<h3>Self Promotion Is Not Only Okay, It’ll Elevate You — promote your skillset</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=602736208&amp;fref=gc&amp;dti=245786539205302">Natalia Ronceria Ceballos</a> is the founder and CEO at LA NRC. She is an advocate for women proudly promoting their skill sets.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Don’t be afraid to ask the big asks!! We still so often undervalue ourselves in negotiations and end up making less than our counterparts doing the same level of work.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Self promotion isn’t a dirty phrase. It’s the opportunity to showcase the skillset that our commitment has chiseled from stone.</p>
<p><strong>How can women promote themselves without feeling over-promotional?</strong></p>
<p>-Talk about achievements through recognizable metrics — You’ve achieved it, it’s okay to talk about it</p>
<p>-Create a specific goal to speak at X amount of conferences and teach your skillset in the upcoming year</p>
<p>-Write about achievements on social platforms like Medium and Quora</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Don’t be afraid to ask the big asks!! We still so often undervalue ourselves in negotiations and end up making less than our counterparts doing the same level of work.” —Natalia Ronceria Ceballos</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Don’t Buy Into The Hustle — figure out work/life schedule that works best for you</h3>
<p>The idea of hustle became a trending topic in the last few years, highlighting the need to work 12+ hour days in the name of your passion. In hindsight, the business world has come to see the lack of scalability of this mindset.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The research is clear: beyond about 40–50 hours per week, the marginal returns from additional work decrease rapidly and quickly become negative,” Dustin Moskovitz, Facebook Co-Founder (<a href="https://www.dailydot.com/via/work-life-balance-amazon-tech-culture/">source</a>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Instead of buying into the hustle, what if we bought into freedom?</strong></p>
<p>The hustle isn’t defined by 12+ hour days, it’s defined by choosing the schedule that allows you to be a savvy business women while maintaining relationships, personal development and health (and the same goes for men).</p>
<p>This schedule maintains long term freedom and the ability to adapt to it changing at any moment is where leaders rise. Hustling for harmony between your schedule and the spontaneity of life is the new definition of “the grind”.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=602736208&amp;fref=gc&amp;dti=245786539205302">Natalia Ronceria Ceballos</a> says, “<em>And forget about work/life balance, I’ve always thought that was deceiving, not everything will get equal shares of your time, talent, &amp; treasure always (family, work, etc) — so strive for harmony, knowing sometimes family will need more of you, sometimes work will, and that is OK</em> <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f917.png" alt="🤗" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2764.png" alt="❤" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />”</p>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><strong>To figure out your ideal schedule ask yourself: what does my ideal day look like and how do I start to add each in each those elements?</strong></p>
<h3>Keep your sights set on the future — stay on top of trends, never stop learning</h3>
<p>The most successful people in the world, such as Warren Buffett, focus on the future of culture and society. They capitalize off of trends and technology shifts by keeping their eyes on the upcoming future.</p>
<p>Michelle Phan, YouTube creator and entrepreneur, saw the future of YouTube when the platform was in its infant stage. She talks about this foresight in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Geek-Girl-Rising-Sisterhood-Shaking/dp/1250112265">Geek Girl Rising</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I knew that the younger generation would see YouTube as the new TV. They [would] come across my channel and … see a library of hundreds of videos. They’re going to want to watch it.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Her videos now have over a billion views, she has launched multiple product lines, and is now a published author. Currently, she is still focused on the future of the content industry and how she can be on the brink of the attention economy as technology continues to change social behavior.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If you want to be a great creator, you have to be your own number one fan first. You have to love what you’re doing. Ten years ago I saw a glimpse of what I wanted to be the future of digital content. If I wanted that to come true, I had to manifest it myself by also making it myself.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>What is happening in your industry right now and what are the options for what comes of it in the future?</strong></p>
<p>The digital revolution has opened the door to a conversation regarding equality. Now, it’s time to walk through the door and change the conversation.</p>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p>Getting started as an entrepreneur can seem like a daunting task, but taking initiative and being willing to learn can lead to a chain reaction of incredible results. We built our internship program to help students reach their entrepreneurial goals, regardless of industry, and gain a community of supporters to help them succeed. We&#8217;re proud to bring on board a new ninja intern who exemplifies the proactive spirit of entrepreneurship.</p>
<h3>Meet Jeron Artest</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-15616" src="https://cohoots.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_6676-1024x683.jpg" alt="Jeron Artest ninja intern" width="456" height="304" /></p>
<p>Jeron Artest joins our team as our new nintern for the fall and spring semesters, and we can&#8217;t wait to see what he accomplishes.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re already incredibly impressed by Jeron&#8217;s wisdom and determination, and he&#8217;s already on his way toward his major career goals. He is a high school student who already knows how to code, recently traveled to China to further his basketball dreams and is committed to achieving the goals he has set for himself.</p>
<h5>His goals:</h5>
<ul>
<li>Learn how to work within a team in an office</li>
<li>Work on different projects to improve/hone programming skills and learn new skills</li>
<li>Networking with others in the same/similar field</li>
<li>Event planning</li>
</ul>
<h5>Why he wanted to work at CO+HOOTS:</h5>
<p>I wanted to work at CO+HOOTS to personally experience the inner workings of a business while also being exposed to other businesses at the same time. It&#8217;s just such a perfect experience. Also, I like dogs, and there are a lot of office dogs here.</p>
<h5>What he believes makes a community successful:</h5>
<p>A community is successful when everyone supports each other unconditionally, whether it&#8217;s by pointing them towards the right direction or personally assisting each other.</p>
<h5>Why he believes being proactive at a young age is important:</h5>
<p>By being proactive at a &#8220;young&#8221; age, you&#8217;ll make your life easier. It&#8217;s like procrastinating on an assignment. If you do it too late, it might not be as good as if you did it early. Being proactive doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean finding a job right now or taking extra hard classes. It can be as simple as going to meetups, or contacting people on LinkedIn or even Twitter. It all benefits your future without all the stress of being an adult.</p>
<h3>Five tips for students to reach their goals by Jeron</h3>
<p>At CO+HOOTS, we believe that age does not have to be a barrier to achieving big goals. We support our our nonprofit arm <a href="http://cohootsfdn.org">CO+HOOTS Foundation</a>&#8216;s efforts to help high school students like Jeron bring their ideas to life at <a href="http://ycmsummit.com">Youth Changemaker Summit</a> and beyond. Sometimes, achieving goals starts with a few simple actions, including these tips written by Jeron:</p>
<p>1. Learn all the things. Any knowledge is the best knowledge.</p>
<p>2. Do what you love so you make the most of your time.</p>
<p>3. Find people who have similar interests to yours. Networks are important.</p>
<p>4. Communicate. It helps everyone around you and yourself understand what&#8217;s going on.</p>
<p>5. Write down your goals and a rough roadmap you can take to reach them.</p>
<h3>Jeron beyond the coworking space</h3>
<h5>Hometown:</h5>
<p>I was born in New York, New York, but I consider home to be Los Angeles.</p>
<h5>What are your own personal hopes and dreams?</h5>
<ul>
<li>Become an entrepreneur</li>
<li>Own several (mainly software-based) businesses; creating/exiting; repeat</li>
<li>Turn current concepts into actual revenue-generating businesses</li>
<li>Become an NBA player</li>
</ul>
<h5>What should the CO+HOOTS community know about you?</h5>
<p>I love trying new types of food. I always try to find a unique place to eat wherever I travel.</p>
<h5>What is one thing people don&#8217;t know about you?</h5>
<p>Nobody knows that I practice yoga.</p>
<h5>Why are you so awesome?</h5>
<p>I am so awesome because I am always learning new things. <!--codes_iframe--></p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><strong>Hometown:</strong> Tempe, AZ</p>
<p><strong>Why did you want to work at CO+HOOTS?</strong></p>
<p>I fell in love with Jenny Poon&#8217;s work and applied for an internship. Honestly, I wasn&#8217;t sure I would be working in such a welcoming environment. I love it here.</p>
<p><strong>What are your hopes and dreams at CO+HOOTS?</strong></p>
<p>At the moment, I am working towards my degree, but I have thought of starting up a company with my best friend once or twice. I hope to build the confidence and the experience that could help me consider making that dream a reality.</p>
<p><strong>Members in CO+HOOTS may be able to help you as well&#8230; What are your own personal hopes and dreams?</strong></p>
<p>My personal hopes and dreams are for travel. I want to go as many places as possible for both work and play. 3D Art is a personal passion of mine and with my graphic design degree, I hope to work with my hands, constantly building in the physical 3D space as well as the Virtual 3D space.</p>
<p><strong>If you had a 100 billion dollars, you would&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>HAH, probably blow it all on silly things. I&#8217;m terrible with money&#8230; Honestly though, I would probably invest in property. Everybody needs a place to rest their head, right? But 100 billion is a lot of money.</p>
<p><strong>What should the CO+HOOTS community know about you?</strong></p>
<p>Umm&#8230; I work at the zoo on the weekends?</p>
<p><strong>What is the one thing people don&#8217;t know about you?</strong></p>
<p>When I first started my Facebook profile, I set my birthday as April 1 as an April Fools prank for those who got the notification. I thought it was funny at the time.</p>
<p><strong>Why are you awesome?</strong></p>
<p>I am a sucker for puns. <!--codes_iframe--></p></div>

His openness to exploring (and admitting) any and all passions is why he fits our culture so well, but his ability to #GSD is the reason why it&#8217;s such a pleasure to have him as one of our ninterns! Did you know Jeremy has already built a custom app for us?</p>
<p>Josh Hanson is a design extraordinaire with an eye for all things branding. Whether it&#8217;s hands-on work or something on the screens, he&#8217;s prepared to help and ready to learn (and probably ready to climb on furniture for the sake of design). We&#8217;re excited to see more of Josh&#8217;s amazing work &#8212; and what his next tattoo may be!</p>

<p>Get to know more about our ninterns as they take on the summer with us:</p>
<h3>Jeremy</h3>
<p><img class="wp-image-14861 alignright" src="https://cohoots.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_5299-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="434" height="289" /></p>
<p><b>Hometown:</b> Glendale, AZ</p>
<p><strong>Why did you want to work at CO+HOOTS?</strong></p>
<p>I am in love with what this space and the Foundation provides to its members and what it stands for. Working on a small team with a shared responsibility to enable people to chase their passions is a no-brainer for me. Very excited to be chosen for the internship this summer and to have a chance to contribute to the community!</p>
<p><strong>What are your hopes and dreams at CO+HOOTS?</strong></p>
<p>I hope to learn all the things! And to contribute wherever I can to make things more efficient, more accessible and more helpful.</p>
<p><b>Members in CO+HOOTS may be able to help you as well… What are your own personal hopes and dreams?</b></p>
<p>My ideal dream would be to one day end up at NASA or SpaceX building software for space exploration. On a more down to Earth level (teehee), I want to help solve all kinds of difficult problems with technology, whatever language or platform that takes me to. Anyone working in the software or web development world that is willing to share their story would be a true hero of mine!</p>
<p><b>If you had 100 billion dollars, you would…</b></p>
<p>That&#8217;s an insane amount of money for a single person to have, so I&#8217;d put away 100 million or so to comfortably live off of and then spend the rest of my life giving the remainder away.</p>
<p><b>What should the CO+HOOTS community know about you?</b></p>
<p>I&#8217;m currently a full-time college student studying Computer Science. I spent 14 years working for a large financial firm in Scottsdale (my first real job ever!) and decided it was time to pursue my dream of being a software developer. Scary and exciting!</p>
<p><b>What is one thing people don’t know about you?</b></p>
<p>I&#8217;m secretly not awesome. Also, I have an unhealthy obsession with Funko Pop figures which has only recently been hampered by the whole full-time college student thing.</p>
<p><b>Why are you so awesome? </b></p>
<p>Well this is awkward&#8230;</p>
<h3>Josh</h3>
<p><strong><img class="wp-image-14867 alignright" src="https://cohoots.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_5301-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="435" height="290" /></strong></p>
<p><strong>Why did you want to work at CO+HOOTS? </strong></p>
<p>I heard amazing things about Eeko Studio/CO+HOOTS through a classmate at school, so I had to check it out. It has been awesome learning about how CO+HOOTS helps entrepreneurs and the community.</p>
<p><strong>What are your hopes and dreams at CO+HOOTS?</strong><br /> I would love to help the any design aspect the team may need. I love print work, branding and making prototypes with my hands.</p>
<p><strong>Members in CO+HOOTS may be able to help you as well&#8230; What are your own personal hopes and dreams?</strong></p>
<p>I would love to learn many different aspects of graphic design from the various team members while interning here. Also to make great connections with my fellow team members, but also the CO+HOOTS members.</p>
<p><b>If you had 100 billion dollars, you would…</b></p>
<p>Most people would say they would stop working, but I&#8217;m not that person. Of course I wouldn&#8217;t work too much, but I love to travel so I would definitely spend some time traveling the world. A hundred billion dollars is a lot of money, so I would of course share some with charities. I just try and live a simple life. I&#8217;m a no frills kind of guy.</p>
<p><b>What should the CO+HOOTS community know about you?</b></p>
<p>I love to travel and have been to many places here in the U.S. and in Europe. Feel free to ask me any questions. I also love dogs, the bigger the better. Oh, and macaroni and cheese is my favorite food.</p>
<p><b>What is one thing people don’t know about you?</b></p>
<p>I have a total of 12 tattoos.</p>
<p><b>Why are you so awesome? </b></p>
<p>There are many reasons why I&#8217;m awesome! I have tattoos, I&#8217;m a graphic designer, I get along with just about anyone and I&#8217;m a &#8220;go with the flow&#8221; kind of guy. <!--codes_iframe--></p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><em>The days of remote positions being purely underpaid telemarketing jobs are gone.</em></p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.studyfinds.org/survey-one-five-office-employees-work-remotely/">One in five people work remotely</a> and over 50% of workers say their company has a work from home policy. What this remote work trend has created is an entirely new workplace lifestyle <em>and a chance for diversification like we have never seen before.</em></p>
<h3>With the ability to recruit from all over the world, we’re in the middle of two major shifts in the workforce.</h3>
<p><strong>Shift One:</strong> Companies have access to talent regardless of location</p>
<p><strong>Shift Two:</strong> Remote workers are having healthier and happier work experiences</p>
<p>InVision, a digital design platform, is looking toward the future and capitalizing on these shifts. They run an entire 700-person team fully remote — and they have been doing so for seven years.</p>
<p>InVision’s Chief People Officer, Mark Frein, told <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/invision-startup-all-employees-work-remotely-2018-9">Business Insider</a> he firmly believes hiring from any location gives InVision an edge as a technology company. Frein isn’t limited to finding talent in New York City and has diversified his workforce to talent around the world. He’s capitalizing on the statistics that show the value of remote workers (<a href="https://biz30.timedoctor.com/remote-workers-infographic/">click here for an infographic on remote work statistics</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li>Ninety-one percent of remote workers get more work done outside of the office</li>
<li>Remote workers are happier with their work than office workers</li>
<li>Remote workers feel more valued at work than office workers</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>“It’s about results, not where your IP address is. We care about what you’re able to do or achieve.” Mark Frein</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Companies like Basecamp, GitLab, Buffer and Splice have also embraced a fully remote team. Basecamp’s founder Jason Fried, transcribed his remote working business strategy into a best-selling book in 2009, <em>Rework</em>. In his book, he explained how remote work was an integral part of his company’s success.</p>
<p><strong>With only a remote team, Fried has amassed over three million Basecamp users.</strong></p>
<p>As the founder of <a href="https://cohoots.com/">CO+HOOTS</a>, a nationally ranked coworking office based in Phoenix, I watch business owners capitalize on having remote teams on a daily basis.</p>
<p>When it comes to innovation and closing business deals, the businesses capitalizing on the freedom that remote work provides are winning.</p>
<p><strong>The future of the workforce is here and this is how to capitalize on the opportunity of remote work.</strong></p>
<h3>Work Environment Will Be A Priority</h3>
<p>When working remotely, the work environment can vary from a table in a coffee shop, to a desk in a local library. Or, for some, it can be sitting in pajamas on the living room couch with your trusty cat pawing at your arm.</p>
<p>Josh Johnson, Senior Product Manager at Dribbble, runs a 50-person remote team from a coworking office. His experience with a remote team taught him that work environments aren’t a cookie cutter template, but a functioning part of an employee’s life. If employers can provide employees with the chance to find the optimal work environment, employers become catalyst to their employees’ health, productivity and longevity instead of inhibitors to their potential.</p>
<p><em>“No single way to work is appropriate for everyone. Some people are mentally and emotionally drained by sitting in a bustling, open office environment for nine hours every day. Others feel the same way about sitting alone at a desk in their home. Some people need to get away from their house to focus and be productive, others are happiest when they can take a 2pm conference call and enjoy a quick after school snack with their kids at 3pm.</em></p>
<p><em>We all win when we stop having tweet wars over which way is better and realize that the best possible job market is one that provides diverse opportunities to all types of people in all types of situations.”</em></p>
<p>The future of remote work depends on employers supporting their employees work productivity, no matter what form it takes.</p>
<p>Companies should take an interest in their employees’ remote office. Some are now providing laptops or a desktop computer. Others are giving stipends for home office furniture like standing desks. Even scheduling a weekly grocery delivery order to keep remote employees energized and healthy.</p>
<h3>Lower Overhead than Traditional Office Space</h3>
<p>All businesses are looking to create higher levels of happiness and lower their bottom line. Very rarely has the two ever come in one package, that is until coworking came around. Coworking space memberships often start at only $99 a month for individuals and allows companies to scale their team quickly and efficiently. This includes fast Wifi, utilities, office equipment, cleaning fees, access to networking events, free parking and more. Not to mention the biggest benefit — helping employees not feel so isolated. The overhead of a typical office is upwards of $3,000 not inclusive of all the utilities, maintenance, furniture and taxes. Keeping employees happy? Priceless.</p>
<p>Josh Padnick of Phoenix-based <a href="https://www.gruntwork.io/">Gruntwork</a> employs 14 remote workers and offers coworking as an employee benefit.</p>
<p><em>“We pay for everyone on our team to use a coworking space if they wish, and about half our team uses the benefit. The reality is that working from home all day every day, and then remaining at home at night can be draining and uninteresting. We also crave the in-person human connection and serendipity that comes from being in a physical workplace. Coworking is a great way to provide these things. You get the physical community, and yet your coworkers are distributed.”</em></p>
<p>Josh (full disclosure: he is a member at CO+HOOTS) spends 80% less revenue on office space than a traditional team does. When these savings are redirected to employee health and training, as well as business development, we see why remote teams are able to scale so quickly. Most spaces offer free trials for a day or a week, which give remote employees the opportunity to decide whether to see if being around other highly efficient workers helps them feel more efficient.</p>
<p>Coworking spaces are the done-for-you office space with professional development built in.</p>
<h3>Work Will No Longer Be 9–5</h3>
<p>The idea of the 9–5 work week is becoming less and less popular among employers. We’re finally realizing, <em>it’s not necessary.</em></p>
<p>Richard Branson recently wrote a piece <a href="https://www.virgin.com/richard-branson/way-we-all-work-going-change">on the future of the workplace</a>: “five days a week with two day weekends and a few weeks of holiday each year has become ingrained in society. However, it wasn’t always the case, and it won’t be in the future.”</p>
<p>Virgin happily applies an atypical work week with its employees and allows them to take off two months if they believe they need to.</p>
<p>The typical work schedule is an antiquated idea of how businesses should run. In most cases, there is no need for an employee to come in at a set period. Even more so, it would bode well for their health if they didn’t. Commuting to a job during “rush hour” is becoming increasingly stressful. Missing out on picking kids up for school does not equate to a great work-life balance. We have as a society switched from working hard to working smart and becoming a workforce that values measuring results over measuring time. It makes sense that 9–5 is dead.</p>
<h3>Hire for Diverse Opinions and Cultural Backgrounds</h3>
<p>What if each problem in your business was looked at by three experts with various backgrounds? Instead of getting the same answer three times, you’d have a variant of answers depending on the past experience of your experts.</p>
<p>The location agnostic factor of remote work means each of your experts stands on a different foundation. They all know the same information and can implement the same strategies but they may come to the project with three perspectives, three prior experiences and three ideas on solving any roadblocks along the way.</p>
<p>Diversity of opinions and cultural backgrounds is what Stephen Olmstead, Chief of Staff at <a href="https://www.invisionapp.com/">InVision</a>, attributes to the team’s ability to problem solve.</p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p>Working with 700 people from around the world means that Stephen’s team isn’t built on the foundation of one person’s experience. It’s built on the foundation of 700. Which foundation sounds sturdier?</p>
<p><strong>The future of the workforce is going to consist of happier workers that are location independent and aren’t hindered by their socioeconomic status, gender or race.</strong></p>
<p>Companies will enjoy the benefits reaped when workers aren’t forced to show up to an uninspiring cubicle-laden dungeon with barely any windows after sitting in hours of traffic. They’ll see more innovation by hopping on a Zoom call for a team meeting and seeing the variety of faces on the screen, all with new experiences and ideas from their varying locations of the world.</p>
<p>Companies comprised of an inclusive and diverse workforce that supports happy workers is the future of work we all deserve.</p>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><em>Guest blog by Michael Zimmerlich of 80/20 Records</em></p>
<p>2018 is a big year for me as it marks 10 years since 80/20 Records was formed.  It’s incredible to think how far I’ve come and yet still how much I have to learn.  But I’ve certainly learned a lot since I’ve started.  As I look back, here are some revelations about staying in business for 10 years.</p>
<h4>Be adaptive</h4>
<p>80/20 Records functions very differently now than it did 10 years ago, or even a year ago.  It’s a constant change of discovering what is working and, more importantly, what isn’t working.</p>
<p>During the first year, I decided to offer management services to one of my artists that extended what I did for them on the record label, which turned into a nightmare.  Last year, I re-thought on how I could provide this to artists and launched a management arm of 80/20 Records, which so far has been very successful on many levels.</p>
<p>For eight years, my company was a side-hustle and I had a full-time job.  When I quit my day job to focus on my company, I moved in with my parents and cut my personal expenses.  I’ve also looked into other ways I could make money on the side that wasn’t as demanding on my time, such as crowdfunding consulting, ghostwriting, creating one-page website templates for artists and more.  Now, I’m focused on building management while maintaining the record label.</p>
<p>If I didn’t adapt to how the music industry was changing, as well as how my personal life was changing, I would’ve shut the doors of 80/20 Records a long time ago.</p>
<h4>You can’t do it alone</h4>
<p>Everyone needs help and I’m certainly no exception.  I’m a co-founder of 80/20 Records, and my partner at the time had a big part on the philosophies of the company we created together that are still a part of the label today.  In fact, my brother was a partner for a while, as well.  He brought infrastructure to the company that I never had before that I still use today.</p>
<p>Every artist I ever represented took a risk on me and my company, which wouldn’t exist without them.  I’ve had 16 interns that contributed in countless ways, everything from taking care of merchandise at shows to social media.  Not to mention all of my colleagues that I’ve met over the years that opened opportunities to me, provided incredible advice, or offered their friendship.  I’m extremely grateful for every single person that has helped me over the past 10 years.</p>
<h4>Be kind to everyone</h4>
<p>Cannot stress this enough.  There is no question in my mind that the reason I’m still in business after 10 years is how I treat others.  Anyone from the artists to my interns to my fellow colleagues, I try as hard as I can to treat them with respect and friendliness.  I make sure to show my gratitude for those who helped me and to pay it forward as often as I can to others.  This is a long-term investment into yourself and your community.</p>
<p>I’ve had falling outs with some of my artists, but I kept it professional and kept in touch with many of them.  In fact, one of my first artists contacted me after three years and apologized on how they handled things.  Most of my business comes from referrals from previous clients, artists and colleagues, who obviously wouldn’t have recommended me if I didn’t do my job and treat them well.  Your community is much smaller than you think and word gets around, both good and bad.</p>
<h4>It’s better to try and fail than not to try at all</h4>
<p>Before I started 80/20 Records, I never worked in the music industry.  I never did an internship with a music business company.  I never took a single music business class.  Instead, I bought two books: one on music business law and the other on record label marketing.  From the record label marketing book, I took note of what I could do, what I couldn’t do and what I thought was just stupid so was going to do something else.  I wanted to run a record label the way I thought it would be run.</p>
<p>My very first artist was a friend of mine that made electronic music.  I found a sample contract in the record label marketing book that I had him sign.  Then did a Google search on how to get your music on iTunes.  This is how I started 80/20 Records, I just…did it.</p>
<p>Things will never ever be perfect.  There will always be something that can be improved upon, but if you wait, you’ll never release anything.  I’ve had artist sign contracts that could’ve been clearer, hosted events that could’ve been planned better, launched marketing campaigns that could’ve been executed better.  But if I didn’t act, it would’ve taken so much longer to do these things.  As a result, I failed a lot.  I’ve lost money on events, lost artists cause I could’ve handled situations better, opportunities that slipped through my fingers.  But none of that would’ve happened if I didn’t just go for it and see what happens.  Life is too short to wonder what if this goes wrong.</p>
<h4>In conclusion</h4>
<p>Probably most important of all is to love what you’re doing.  It’s going to be a pain at times, chances are you’ll probably get stressed out or depressed, but in the end if you endure the bad times to appreciate the good times, then you know you have something worth fighting for.  I like to put it &#8220;if you don’t mind the ‘BS,’ then you know you found your place.&#8221; I love every single minute of what I do.  And I look forward to the next 10 years.</p>

<p>80/20 Records is an independent record label and management company based in Phoenix, AZ.</p>
<p>With over 10 years of experience in the music industry, Mike has been involved with 15 album releases, as well as several music videos. The artists he’s personally represented have opened for acts such as George Clinton and the Parliament Funkadelic, The Mighty Mighty Bosstones, Twenty One Pilots, Catfish and the Bottlemen, Maroon 5, Capital Cities, Phantogram, MR MS, Animal Collective and Beck.</p>
<p>To help raise funds to record albums for artists on 80/20 Records led him into crowdfunding. He successfully raised over $10,000 for his first campaign.  Since then, he’s helped several campaigns successfully reach their goal amounts and now advise others to achieve the same. To date, the campaigns Mike has assisted with raised over $130,000. <!--codes_iframe--></p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><div>Connor Waslo is a social entrepreneur who is already working on his own startup before starting college. As he takes his proactive steps to ruling the world, we&#8217;re excited to give him hands-on experience with all that goes into building a business. In the words of Connor Waslo (please read in an stellar Australian accent), &#8220;CO+HOOTS has all of that!&#8221; And now we have him to teach us how to wiggle our ears.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>Get our nintern&#8217;s two cents on life before they&#8217;re worth one Bitcoin:</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><b>Hometown: </b>Phoenix, AZ</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><b>Why did you want to work at CO+HOOTS? </b></div>
<div><b> </b>I work best surrounded by social people and lively environments. CO+HOOTS has all of that! As I work on my own startup, I&#8217;ll take any opportunity I can to learn how businesses run and to meet people living my dream. Interning here is basically the perfect opportunity for me to move towards accomplishing all sorts of goals.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><b>What are your hopes and dreams at CO+HOOTS? </b></div>
<div>Fame, fortune, a team of my own interns. Just kidding. I want to meet as many people as I can and absorb as much advice as possible. Capitalizing on such a great learning experience is the ultimate goal.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><b>Members in CO+HOOTS may be able to help you as well… What are your own personal hopes and dreams?</b></div>
<div>I hope to run my own successful startup. Ideally, once I&#8217;ve found my unicorn, I can help other people run their startups as efficiently as possible. Entrepreneurship is such a fantastic skill and someday I want to help kids realize that they don&#8217;t have to work for anybody. They can work for themselves.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><b>If you had 100 billion dollars, you would… </b></div>
<div><b> </b>Invest in education and environmental preservation.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><b>What should the CO+HOOTS community know about you? </b></div>
<div>I love meeting with new people and picking their brain about business, programming, life or anything! I appreciate all sorts of perspectives and would love to meet all of you.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><b>What is one thing people don’t know about you? </b></div>
<div>I&#8217;m not Australian or Russian but I can talk in some pretty decent Australian and Russian accents.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><b>Why are you so awesome? </b></div>
<div>I can wiggle my ears. Hands free. Basically a super power, y&#8217;know? I got offered to be a member of the Avengers but it didn&#8217;t quite fit in my schedule so I had to turn them down.</div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p>Over the past semester, I had the opportunity to intern at CO+HOOTS out of midtown Phoenix. I had never had an internship before with any company, let alone a company so unique, and I was eager for the next months ahead of me. What I gained from my experience was something I would have never expected, and something I would never trade.</p>
<h4>CO+mmunity</h4>
<p>I had never heard of anything like CO+HOOTS before, let alone had the chance to work in such a space. I was intrigued by the idea of coworking in a community that fostered collaboration. It seemed like a mouthful, but I was excited to see just what it meant. From my short time at CO+HOOTS, I was able to learn not only what it meant to be in a community, but also what it means to belong to a community. From brief conversations with members in the kitchen, to getting to know businesses and entrepreneurs within the work space, I learned that there is always someone willing to teach you something if you make the time to learn.</p>
<h4>CO+llaboration</h4>
<p>I have found in other jobs I previously had that not everyone was willing to work or listen to someone new to the workforce that had little relevant experience to offer; this was NOT the case when I came to CO+HOOTS. Immediately, my ideas and opinions were welcomed, and even taken into consideration on projects big and small. My skills were put to use in ways that I wouldn’t have thought of on my own. I was given the chance to collaborate alongside other interns, as well as industry professionals, with the skills and connections made from the networking given to me by CO+HOOTS.</p>
<h4>CO+work &amp; CO+care</h4>
<p>When I came to CO+HOOTS, I was pleasantly surprised by how comfortable I felt from my very first visit. I was welcomed by friendly faces and down-to-earth people that I could connect with on a business and personal level. As a typical college student, I have a lot on my plate and am pretty overwhelmed a majority of the time. When I was having a bad day (okay, bad week), I was able to go to my supervisors and express my frustrations with school, work and just life in general. It felt good knowing that I worked with people that actually cared about my well-being and how I was doing when I was outside the office, too.</p>
<p>From my time at CO+HOOTS, I learned an indescribable amount of life lessons about business, entrepreneurship, networking and what it means to have a friend. As my time at CO+HOOTS comes to a close, I can’t help but think of what fellow intern Bryce Manhardt likes to remind us of from The Lego Movie: “Everything is awesome when you’re part of a team.” Although my time with the team has come to a close, I know I’ll be able to call upon anyone of them whenever I need a helping hand. <!--codes_iframe--></p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><span>When choosing a career path, whether it be for the first time or fifth time, it can be overwhelming. Whether you are a recent college grad, high school senior or experienced industry professional, there can be so many directions to go, you may not know which way is up after a while. CO+HOOTS member Steven Rudolph said it best when he compared it to going to an ice cream shop: “There are too many choices. You don’t know which type of ice cream to choose.”</span></p>
<p><span>This is the very dilemma Steven set out to solve with his company <a href="http://www.multiplenatures.com/">Multiple Natures</a>. He said the aim of the company “is to help people identify their potential and to align it with the work that they do so they get greater fulfillment and success, life balance and direction.” It was after a journey practically around the world that Steven was able to not only discover his love of teaching, but also “(find in his) own evolution that (he is) good at finding other people,” as well.</span></p>
<p><span>His journey would begin with his undergraduate degree from the University of Florida, where he would then move to New York City in a hope to find “fame and fortune as a rockstar.” As all authentic rockstars start off, Steven got a job to help pay the bills, but what would happen next would ultimately change his career path altogether. This part-time job? Teaching. </span></p>
<p><span>“I fell in love… in my first classes and I thought, ‘How come nobody ever told me about teaching?’ I didn’t know I had this ability,” Steven said. </span></p>
<p><span>This would begin the trek across the world, which took Steven to Japan and then India, where he would create Jiva Public School. What started with eight children grew to more than 2,000 and over his 20 years spent in India, other schools picked it up. </span></p>
<p><span>“The core of the program is that every child has to do some introspection, figure out what their strengths are and make the decisions for their course of study,” Steven said.</span></p>
<p><span>Steven would then advance to Europe, taking on France, Switzerland and Lithuania. He created a program where “people were choosing the course and direction of their life based on who they were.” People everywhere have been choosing it for the different experience it brings, so much so that the website is offered in three languages: English, French and even Lithuanian. </span></p>
<p><span>He soon knew it was time to build it out. That’s when he decided it was time to move back to the U.S. and fully build Multiple Natures to scale.</span></p>
<p><span>Mentor and friend Francine Hardaway had been selling the city of Phoenix to Steven for years before the move back to the States, but was able to officially convince him after his first visit to CO+HOOTS. Steven said Francine told him, “Don’t even start thinking about apartments. The first thing you go do is you drive over to CO+HOOTS right now, and you meet Odeen and Jenny, and you get yourself a desk there. Then, once you’ve got your place, then you find an apartment and you’ll see everything will fall into place.”</span></p>
<p><span>Heeding her advice, Steven made the journey to midtown and realized CO+HOOTS is where he needed to be. </span></p>
<p><span>“It gave me a beautiful, energetic, focused environment that enabled me to feel instantly at home, with respect to my business and my work,” Steven said. “There was no friction here. When I sat at my desk, I felt energized by the other people who are around the community that’s here, which is very supportive. It gave me a grounding and insights into the entrepreneurial scene.”</span></p>
<p><span>Multiple Natures has been able to “create tools that are best in class…for working with clients in the process of identification and alignment of potential.” In this, the company has been able to help countless people in finding the right career path for them. Being a part of the CO+HOOTS community has provided Steven with the chance to not only help others in solving their own ice cream dilemmas, but serve as a valuable asset to the community and fellow entrepreneurs. </span> <!--codes_iframe--></p></div>
