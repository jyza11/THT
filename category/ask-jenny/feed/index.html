				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone’s desk setup is a little different. Some people are total minimalists, while others claim to know where everything is. While your workstation should always be yours to make your own, following great desk setup strategies can also help your productivity grow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you have a </span><a href="https://cohoots.com/locations/phoenix/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">dedicated desk</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a coworking space or a dedicated workstation at home, your surroundings impact your efficiency. This includes everything from where your work tools are placed to how far your monitor is from your face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To help you create a blueprint for your workstation, we asked our founder Jenny Poon to provide some </span><a href="https://cohoots.com/2018/03/19/our-desk-spirations/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">inspiration for your desk setup</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We’ll also explain three setup tips you can draw from her example and provide three more ideas you can easily implement.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jenny’s desk setup</span></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our founder is a self-proclaimed efficiency nut and if you’ve ever seen her getting sh*t done, you know she’s doing something right. Here’s what she has to say about her desk setup:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My desk is a super important part of my efficiency process. I make sure I have Post-its and a notepad handy, as I always take notes. I have found having a desk that has drawers has been a godsend for keeping my desk tidy and clean, but with easy access to the necessities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have a larger monitor and run off of a laptop, so I can be mobile when I need to, but when designing or working on spreadsheets, I can project up. I found out I could also connect my iPad as an extension to my screen and that has been super helpful, as I just keep my Slack on there so I can always be available via chat for my now-remote team.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why her desk setup works</span></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So how does this desk setup boost productivity? Let’s dissect the three main ergonomic strategies that Jenny uses and how you can implement them, too.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Most-used items are kept within arm’s reach.</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When organizing your desk, your most important tools should always be placed closest to your seat or standing mat. If you love jotting down notes like Jenny, keeping your pen and paper nearby will allow you to grab it in an instant, without shifting away from your primary task.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bonus points: If you keep these heavily used items in designated spots, you naturally create a physical workflow for yourself.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Cleanliness is prioritized.</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if you know where everything is, a messy desk can hinder your productivity. By keeping least-used items and knick-knacks stored away, Jenny’s desk setup minimizes distractions and allows her to efficiently navigate her workspace.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A clean desk can also feel more inviting, whereas clutter can add to your stress. In addition to investing in drawers (if your desk doesn’t include any), you may consider purchasing basic accessories like </span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/OHill-Organizer-Management-Organizing-Adhesive/dp/B071FXZBMV/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cable clips</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Simple-Trending-Supplies-Organizer-Vertical/dp/B07SNBHQ28/ref=sr_1_7?crid=31GORS15ZFSN0&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=desk+organizers&amp;qid=1591278662&amp;sprefix=desk+organ%2Caps%2C246&amp;sr=8-7"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tiered desk organizers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. It’s customized for her work habits.</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone works differently, but Jenny is always on-the-go. By using her laptop as a primary device and casting her other tech in purposeful, supporting roles, she can easily unplug, pack up and head to wherever she needs to be.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alternatively, if you’re typically stationary throughout your workday, you can make a desktop computer the star of the show to avoid switching between devices.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">3 more desk setup ideas for productivity</span></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As our founder’s example has shown, the most efficient workstations are always neat and purposeful. Here are some extra desk setup tips that you can implement to drive your productivity further along:</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Support your natural posture</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keeping an upright posture can enhance your focus, while warding off common health problems for office workers like bad backs and carpal tunnel — which, of course, can cause highly distracting aches and pains. Your desk setup can actually encourage you to sit properly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To promote good posture:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Keep your monitor at eye level.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Whether you’re sitting down or using a standing desk, your monitor should help you face forward without a hunched back, and be close enough so you’re not craning your neck.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Choose the right chair.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> An ergonomic chair can encourage you to keep your spine straight and supported. When setting it up, make sure it’s at a level that keeps your feet flat, while allowing you to reach straight for your keyboard without bent wrists.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Increase natural light</span></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.inc.com/cameron-albert-deitch/office-design-productivity-success-capital-one-study.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Natural light is key</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for greater productivity and better mental health. Positioning your desk close to a window will help you boost your happiness and your focus all at once. Natural light helps you take advantage of your circadian rhythm and stay awake, even without the coffee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Live in a box? Daylight bulbs that keep you energized are recommended.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Choose your decor wisely</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While most unnecessary items should be kept off your desk, keeping a small amount of decor can boost your mood while you’re working. Choose a few items that you love, but doesn’t take up a lot of space, such as a family photo.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Small plants are always a good option, as the presence of greenery can lead to </span><a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/office-plants-boost-productivity#:~:text=Plants%20can%20add%20more%20to,up%20to%2015%20per%20cent.&amp;text=%22Plants%20aren't%20used%20to,very%20fast%2Dvarying%20environments.%22"><span style="font-weight: 400;">15% more productivity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just make sure your decor isn’t in the way when you’re reaching for essential items.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create your happy place</span></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you have a great desk setup that’s customized for you, your workspace can be your productive place </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> your happy place. There aren’t actually any rules when it comes to designing your desk, but when you use our ergonomic strategies, you will feel your efficiency grow.</span></p>
