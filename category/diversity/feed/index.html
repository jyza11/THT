If you haven’t already, now is absolutely the time to invest in inclusion to drive measurable results — and for the greater good, of course.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://cohoots.com/about/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our team</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is focused on bringing diverse entrepreneurs together, because we know a culture of inclusion can lift up an entire community. In the same vein, creating a team filled with unique individuals whose opinions are equally valued can make a world of difference within your organization.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But why exactly are diversity and inclusion worth the effort? And how can you make it happen? We’re here to help you get the answers you need.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is diversity in the workplace exactly?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Workplace diversity occurs when employees at each level of your organization can be distinguished through their unique perspectives and experiences.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diversity can take many forms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your team may consist of people of different genders, races, sexual orientations, education levels, physical abilities and ages — all of which impact their personal experiences.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Professional diversity is important, too. Even within the same department, a diverse team will have a wide variety of skill sets and ways of thinking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re worried about accidentally hiring mortal enemies, do not fear. A commitment to diversity doesn’t mean you need to look for polar opposites. No matter how different your team members are, they should all feel connected by the same core values. This overarching unity will enable your business to benefit from the positive impact of diversity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Benefits of diversity at work</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diversity in the workplace isn’t just a fad. Business leaders stand behind it because it leads to greater efficiency and longevity. We’ll list out a few ways you can directly benefit from encouraging diversity at work, but we promise this is just the start of a million reasons why inclusion matters.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. It enhances your decision-making.</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you bring together people with unique knowledge and perspectives, you will naturally have a team that can tackle challenges from every angle. As you bounce ideas off one another, you’ll develop more creative solutions, twice as fast — and the decisions you make will be </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/company/stories/new-research-diversity-inclusion-better-decision-making-work/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">better 87% of the time</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diversity is also the key to weeding out tone-deaf marketing before it’s blasted out. When your team actually represents the diverse makeup of the greater community, you eliminate your blind spots and stay hyper-aware about how your audience may perceive your message.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. It boosts your profits.</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you invest in workplace diversity, you get returns. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just looking at gender diversity, having a more balanced mix of men and </span><a href="https://cohoots.com/2019/03/26/lessons-from-women-in-leadership/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">women in leadership</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can actually increase the likelihood of above-average profits </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/karstenstrauss/2018/01/25/more-evidence-that-company-diversity-leads-to-better-profits/#1853b0991bc7"><span style="font-weight: 400;">by 21%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diversity is also </span><a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/346229"><span style="font-weight: 400;">known to attract</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> top talent, investors and customers, so if your dedication to building a diverse team doesn’t create immediate results, it will boost and continue to boost your ROI soon enough.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. It keeps your employees engaged.</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No one wants to work for a team where they don’t feel included. Diversity is directly linked to </span><a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/au/en/pages/human-capital/articles/role-diversity-practices-inclusion-trust-employee-engagement.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">higher levels of trust</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which ultimately leads to employee engagement — a huge factor in organizational productivity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pairing diversity with a strong culture of inclusion will further help your team members feel valued and heard. Because they feel comfortable with and connected to the broader team, they’re also less likely to leave. With employee retention rates high, you won’t have to eat the </span><a href="https://www.hrdive.com/news/study-turnover-costs-employers-15000-per-worker/449142/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">extremely high cost</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of employee turnover.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to build a culture of inclusivity</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building an inclusive team is an active process that requires you to do more than stick diverse people together. Here are some tips on how you can promote and nurture a healthy, inclusive culture as you build your diverse team:</span></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Encourage collaboration.<span style="font-weight: 400;"> When your employees are working in silos, this can hinder your progress. Find ways for your team members to work together, so they can learn from each other and build off of each other’s ideas.</span></b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Offer diversity training.<span style="font-weight: 400;"> Even if you’re confident that all your team members value diversity, almost everyone has implicit biases that they need to overcome. Training can help your employees grow, while building trust and acceptance.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Support professional development.<span style="font-weight: 400;"> Once you achieve strong diversity, you need to continue engaging employees by helping them advance in their careers. This could be achieved through mentorship, a professional development stipend or a similar initiative.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Again, remember that diversity in the workplace only occurs when there’s diversity at every level. Your leadership team must reflect your commitment to inclusion, or else your efforts will be drowned by an echo chamber of decision-makers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<h3>Make diversity an ongoing commitment</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diversity isn’t created in one day, nor does inclusion continue if you fail to nurture it. Making diversity and inclusion core values in your business will help you outperform your competitors, while keeping your team fully satisfied.</span></p>
