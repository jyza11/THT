<h3><b>CITY OF MESA AND CO+HOOTS PARTNER TO LAUNCH NEW DIGITAL PLATFORM TO HELP SMALL BUSINESSES AFFECTED BY PANDEMIC</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">CO+HOOTS’ new resource hub re-envisions </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">government technical assistance programs.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Phoenix and Mesa, Ariz: July 13, 2020 — CO+HOOTS, a globally-recognized entrepreneur support organization, today announced the launch of HUUB, a robust digital platform to support local governments in revitalizing small businesses during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. The City of Mesa will be the first to apply this technology driven-approach to business recovery, utilizing CO+HOOTS’ HUUB network to launch the Mesa CARES Technical Assistance Program and Resource Center.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The launch of this digital platform will bring community partner organizations and leaders together to specifically help small businesses in Mesa. In one central place, business owners will have access to engaging and relevant webinars that will provide tactical on-demand solutions, invaluable peer-to-peer groups, funding opportunities and the ability to book on-the-fly sessions with top advisors and consultants. Qualifying Mesa businesses that qualify will receive training, education, and services valued at $15,000 to help them emerge from the pandemic. There are already more than 100 businesses that have applied and been accepted into the Mesa CARES Technical Assistance Program.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Given the strong demand for recovery support due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we&#8217;re excited to see Mesa take an active approach in responding to the needs of their business community” said Jenny Poon, founder and CEO of CO+HOOTS.  “By partnering with the City of Mesa, we aim to improve the resiliency of the business community that is the backbone of Mesa while creating efficiencies for the City. We are excited and prepared to take our decade of experience in incubating entrepreneur communities and be of service in this critical time. With our digital platform, cities and community partners can now provide a faster response to small business owners in need and help cities do more, no matter where they are.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mesa Cares for Small Businesses resource center is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">made possible by the federal Coronavirus Relief Fund under the CARES Act. Many of Mesa’s community partners will be coming together to provide resources to entrepreneurs through this platform including A New Leaf, LISC, Chicanos Por La Causa, Local First Arizona, Mesa Chamber of Commerce, Benedictine University at Mesa, Northern Arizona University and the East Valley Hispanic Chamber.</span><span style="font-size: 20px;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;More than half of small business owners surveyed by the City of Mesa said they were significantly affected by COVID-19,&#8221; Mayor John Giles said. &#8220;The Mesa CARES Small Business Technical Assistance Program serves small business owners by connecting them to the individualized help they need. We are thrilled to partner with CO+HOOTS to offer easy access to quality business support that strengthens Mesa’s economic prosperity.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To qualify for free access to the platform and funding resources, Mesa entrepreneurs and small business owners can apply at </span><a href="https://mesa.joinhuub.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">mesa.joinhuub.com/</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Applications are open right now and are on a first-come, first-serve basis. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">One of HUUB’s main objectives is to directly help entrepreneurs launch, grow and scale their businesses. And because the platform combines CO+HOOTS’ community-building and incubation framework with technology, it also provides the necessary tools for local governments to measure success, manage consultants for technical assistance and make smarter decisions. The detailed reporting and impact tracking gives economic development teams the ability to scale their support through technology and quickly identify the changing needs of their business community, allowing more time to focus on retaining businesses and recruiting new ones.</span></p>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p class="graf graf--p">We are facing two infections. COVID and SYSTEMIC RACISM. Both require a deconstruction of every aspect of our lives to properly combat. Let’s look at how our government responded to COVID at a city level. Here in Phoenix our city split up into teams, all tackling different issues.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Some teams worked on supporting small biz, some on education, some on social services, discussions on how police need to enforce safety measures, close convos with health department etc. Together a plan was hatched to quickly address the many challenges that come with a massive epidemic. The result was rapid response, support and even reform. Grants were launched at a local level, regulations were loosened to allow faster production of a vaccine. People were sent money. We reshaped an entire federal loan program and reclassified applicants so more could apply. Conversely, SYSTEMIC RACISM VIRUS has led to thousands of deaths annually and a consistent backwards mobility of an entire population. The government has had one strategy: suppression. Led by our tyrant president, our government activated military, curfews and attempt to control the story.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">One virus attacks fast with a 2% fatality rate and can be clearly seen. The other is silent, slower and has rooted itself in every single human on our planet. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-06/race-and-police-shootings-what-new-research-says">The latter also results in black people being 2.5x likely to be shot</a> and one in three going to prison. If we aren’t addressing the systemic racism virus that has infected us all like the public health issue it is, then we aren’t treating it at all. We have seen how quickly government can shift and apply support under a pandemic, the same approach should be taken.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="graf graf--p"><span style="font-size: 20px;"><em><strong>The latter also results in black people being 2.5x likely to be shot and one in three going to prison.</strong></em></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="graf graf--p">This racism pandemic has affected every sector of our society, from education to economics, from police enforcement to public policy. From our innovation ecosystem to our internet infrastructure. It all slants to support the division and marginalization of black communities. While it may seem impossible to tackle racism in America, I’m confident if we took the same approach we took with COVID we’d move the needle. Divide up into teams, collaborate, identify one small change you can make every day and collectively we will push the boulder up the hill.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Every government/industry/biz/individual should assess what role it has played in creating the inequities that exist and begin devising plans to attack this virus so it doesn’t mutate to a new strain. First step, is realizing it is a man-made virus and we are all infected.</p>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><span>Here at CO+HOOTS, our desk space is where ambition plus hard work equals blood, sweat, tears and RESULTS.  To some, an empty desk may be just that. But to us, it is an entreprenerd&#8217;s canvas ready and waiting to be painted by your productive madness. </span></p>
<p><span>From tools to gimmicks to things that bring us efficiency and pleasure, the items we bring to work with us have some sort of purpose.  We call them our Desk-Spirations. They reveal a little bit about who we are and what drives our momentous spirits. </span></p>
<p><span>They keep the ball rolling. Plus, they look great. Go ahead and take a look! </span></p>
<h3><b>Desk-Spirations for Motivation </b></h3>
<h4></h4>
<h4><span>Family Photos </span></h4>
<p><span>What better way to revamp your motivation than to have those most important to you staring you right in the face? Of course, they are there to cheer you on. </span><span>“You got this!” “We support you!” “Feed me a treat when you get home!” (Don’t forget: For Cohootians, pets are family too.)</span></p>
<p><img class="wp-image-14483 alignnone" src="https://cohoots.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/familyphoto-1024x768.jpg" alt="Source: Aaron Kes " width="432" height="324" /></p>
<h4><span>Quotes</span></h4>
<p>Training your brain to think positive thoughts is an invaluable personal development skill. And here at CO+HOOTS, we are all about pushing past our limits. We love to have motivational quotes on our desk. Double points go to those who have them framed, hand-lettered and given to them as a gift from a friend.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-14487 alignnone" src="https://cohoots.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/IMG_4793-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="462" height="308" /></p>
<h3><b>Desk+Spirations for Efficiency </b></h3>
<h4><span>Screen Space </span></h4>
<p><span>How many monitors does it take for you to get down to business? One? Two? Three? Four? Whatever the count is for you, our space is available to make it your own. Right now, the winning number in our office is three. But, who&#8217;s counting?  </span></p>
<h3><b>Desk+Spirations for a Hoot </b></h3>
<h4><span>Fun Mouse Pad </span></h4>
<p><span>Why so serious? Sometimes, in the midst of all our deadlines, we need those little reminders to relax, take it easy and have some fun. Mouse pads with dog-faced tacos will probably do the trick. It hits both marks on usability and fun! A win-win in our books.</span></p>
<h4><span>Music</span></h4>
<p><span>For us, music isn’t just the coffee shop tunes you hear in the background. (Don’t worry, we’ve got that too). </span><span>In our workspace, music can be seen as a Cohootian hanging his guitar on the wall right behind <a href="https://www.gearhungry.com/best-l-shaped-desk/">his desk</a>. Whatever it is that keeps you in tune. Go ahead and rock out to your own beat!</span></p>
<p><img class="wp-image-14485 alignnone" src="https://cohoots.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/IMG_4759-761x1024.jpg" alt="" width="312" height="419" /></p>
<h4><span>Plants &amp; Rocks</span></h4>
<p><span>Cohootians love feeling close to nature. We LOVE it. You’ll see work spaces decorated with air plants, geologic rocks and orchids, and frequent flyers posted next to tall, open windows streaming in natural light.</span></p>
<p><img class="wp-image-14486 alignnone" src="https://cohoots.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/IMG_4778-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="448" height="299" /></p>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><em>The days of remote positions being purely underpaid telemarketing jobs are gone.</em></p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.studyfinds.org/survey-one-five-office-employees-work-remotely/">One in five people work remotely</a> and over 50% of workers say their company has a work from home policy. What this remote work trend has created is an entirely new workplace lifestyle <em>and a chance for diversification like we have never seen before.</em></p>
<h3>With the ability to recruit from all over the world, we’re in the middle of two major shifts in the workforce.</h3>
<p><strong>Shift One:</strong> Companies have access to talent regardless of location</p>
<p><strong>Shift Two:</strong> Remote workers are having healthier and happier work experiences</p>
<p>InVision, a digital design platform, is looking toward the future and capitalizing on these shifts. They run an entire 700-person team fully remote — and they have been doing so for seven years.</p>
<p>InVision’s Chief People Officer, Mark Frein, told <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/invision-startup-all-employees-work-remotely-2018-9">Business Insider</a> he firmly believes hiring from any location gives InVision an edge as a technology company. Frein isn’t limited to finding talent in New York City and has diversified his workforce to talent around the world. He’s capitalizing on the statistics that show the value of remote workers (<a href="https://biz30.timedoctor.com/remote-workers-infographic/">click here for an infographic on remote work statistics</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li>Ninety-one percent of remote workers get more work done outside of the office</li>
<li>Remote workers are happier with their work than office workers</li>
<li>Remote workers feel more valued at work than office workers</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>“It’s about results, not where your IP address is. We care about what you’re able to do or achieve.” Mark Frein</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Companies like Basecamp, GitLab, Buffer and Splice have also embraced a fully remote team. Basecamp’s founder Jason Fried, transcribed his remote working business strategy into a best-selling book in 2009, <em>Rework</em>. In his book, he explained how remote work was an integral part of his company’s success.</p>
<p><strong>With only a remote team, Fried has amassed over three million Basecamp users.</strong></p>
<p>As the founder of <a href="https://cohoots.com/">CO+HOOTS</a>, a nationally ranked coworking office based in Phoenix, I watch business owners capitalize on having remote teams on a daily basis.</p>
<p>When it comes to innovation and closing business deals, the businesses capitalizing on the freedom that remote work provides are winning.</p>
<p><strong>The future of the workforce is here and this is how to capitalize on the opportunity of remote work.</strong></p>
<h3>Work Environment Will Be A Priority</h3>
<p>When working remotely, the work environment can vary from a table in a coffee shop, to a desk in a local library. Or, for some, it can be sitting in pajamas on the living room couch with your trusty cat pawing at your arm.</p>
<p>Josh Johnson, Senior Product Manager at Dribbble, runs a 50-person remote team from a coworking office. His experience with a remote team taught him that work environments aren’t a cookie cutter template, but a functioning part of an employee’s life. If employers can provide employees with the chance to find the optimal work environment, employers become catalyst to their employees’ health, productivity and longevity instead of inhibitors to their potential.</p>
<p><em>“No single way to work is appropriate for everyone. Some people are mentally and emotionally drained by sitting in a bustling, open office environment for nine hours every day. Others feel the same way about sitting alone at a desk in their home. Some people need to get away from their house to focus and be productive, others are happiest when they can take a 2pm conference call and enjoy a quick after school snack with their kids at 3pm.</em></p>
<p><em>We all win when we stop having tweet wars over which way is better and realize that the best possible job market is one that provides diverse opportunities to all types of people in all types of situations.”</em></p>
<p>The future of remote work depends on employers supporting their employees work productivity, no matter what form it takes.</p>
<p>Companies should take an interest in their employees’ remote office. Some are now providing laptops or a desktop computer. Others are giving stipends for home office furniture like standing desks. Even scheduling a weekly grocery delivery order to keep remote employees energized and healthy.</p>
<h3>Lower Overhead than Traditional Office Space</h3>
<p>All businesses are looking to create higher levels of happiness and lower their bottom line. Very rarely has the two ever come in one package, that is until coworking came around. Coworking space memberships often start at only $99 a month for individuals and allows companies to scale their team quickly and efficiently. This includes fast Wifi, utilities, office equipment, cleaning fees, access to networking events, free parking and more. Not to mention the biggest benefit — helping employees not feel so isolated. The overhead of a typical office is upwards of $3,000 not inclusive of all the utilities, maintenance, furniture and taxes. Keeping employees happy? Priceless.</p>
<p>Josh Padnick of Phoenix-based <a href="https://www.gruntwork.io/">Gruntwork</a> employs 14 remote workers and offers coworking as an employee benefit.</p>
<p><em>“We pay for everyone on our team to use a coworking space if they wish, and about half our team uses the benefit. The reality is that working from home all day every day, and then remaining at home at night can be draining and uninteresting. We also crave the in-person human connection and serendipity that comes from being in a physical workplace. Coworking is a great way to provide these things. You get the physical community, and yet your coworkers are distributed.”</em></p>
<p>Josh (full disclosure: he is a member at CO+HOOTS) spends 80% less revenue on office space than a traditional team does. When these savings are redirected to employee health and training, as well as business development, we see why remote teams are able to scale so quickly. Most spaces offer free trials for a day or a week, which give remote employees the opportunity to decide whether to see if being around other highly efficient workers helps them feel more efficient.</p>
<p>Coworking spaces are the done-for-you office space with professional development built in.</p>
<h3>Work Will No Longer Be 9–5</h3>
<p>The idea of the 9–5 work week is becoming less and less popular among employers. We’re finally realizing, <em>it’s not necessary.</em></p>
<p>Richard Branson recently wrote a piece <a href="https://www.virgin.com/richard-branson/way-we-all-work-going-change">on the future of the workplace</a>: “five days a week with two day weekends and a few weeks of holiday each year has become ingrained in society. However, it wasn’t always the case, and it won’t be in the future.”</p>
<p>Virgin happily applies an atypical work week with its employees and allows them to take off two months if they believe they need to.</p>
<p>The typical work schedule is an antiquated idea of how businesses should run. In most cases, there is no need for an employee to come in at a set period. Even more so, it would bode well for their health if they didn’t. Commuting to a job during “rush hour” is becoming increasingly stressful. Missing out on picking kids up for school does not equate to a great work-life balance. We have as a society switched from working hard to working smart and becoming a workforce that values measuring results over measuring time. It makes sense that 9–5 is dead.</p>
<h3>Hire for Diverse Opinions and Cultural Backgrounds</h3>
<p>What if each problem in your business was looked at by three experts with various backgrounds? Instead of getting the same answer three times, you’d have a variant of answers depending on the past experience of your experts.</p>
<p>The location agnostic factor of remote work means each of your experts stands on a different foundation. They all know the same information and can implement the same strategies but they may come to the project with three perspectives, three prior experiences and three ideas on solving any roadblocks along the way.</p>
<p>Diversity of opinions and cultural backgrounds is what Stephen Olmstead, Chief of Staff at <a href="https://www.invisionapp.com/">InVision</a>, attributes to the team’s ability to problem solve.</p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p>Working with 700 people from around the world means that Stephen’s team isn’t built on the foundation of one person’s experience. It’s built on the foundation of 700. Which foundation sounds sturdier?</p>
<p><strong>The future of the workforce is going to consist of happier workers that are location independent and aren’t hindered by their socioeconomic status, gender or race.</strong></p>
<p>Companies will enjoy the benefits reaped when workers aren’t forced to show up to an uninspiring cubicle-laden dungeon with barely any windows after sitting in hours of traffic. They’ll see more innovation by hopping on a Zoom call for a team meeting and seeing the variety of faces on the screen, all with new experiences and ideas from their varying locations of the world.</p>
<p>Companies comprised of an inclusive and diverse workforce that supports happy workers is the future of work we all deserve.</p>

<b>We don’t have Daylight Saving Time in our vocabulary.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Why let an hour go to waste when you could be getting so much done? Whatever you do, don’t follow your instinct to set your clock. We won’t even think to warn you before you show up an hour late to work.</span> <b>We’re the place innovators are flocking to.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Our entrepreneurs have won awards from </span><a href="https://www.ces.tech/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CES</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><a href="https://www.cohootsfdn.org/youthstartup"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our foundation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> gives young innovators a taste of the startup world.

<h3><b>Things you should know</b></h3>
<p><b>We often forget how unnecessarily dramatic our weather is. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">It went from 50 to 80 degrees on February 10? The sun must have come out. Flash flood? It’s just monsoon season. Getting swallowed by a demonic cloud of dust? That’s your average haboob.</span> https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153820604203230&amp;set=p.10153820604203230&amp;type=1&amp;opaqueCursor=Abr_Q_KlElF8CT8FDEWPsIepvRYyZxBx_964PCC_KhCyFQYPde4ujwpsPCJiH3J6-sX5rkUXFc1ftDnGU4ajW3Vqk_ejY9xCYEOPLL66EUi0sIGtpuvrgzW6QTfNTD6mkecwMCCck-QMi5OlgrB357yyWdOVTTdXNl-GTy84DbiTVxvfGoptyqRNZGxh1pDOn3tQklYFdU5ab1BvYAZGg7eMXUdaw-srtvYR41eNBX1_tR_5ZGP6QOmXBC9ybyeu4CcRR01cfWUY_mpYQTzASKZ_pD27L_pbkuW8L3HOTlDW4yUnLuXVcaAnCpf2tDoDz-RoEJMqXsKFKcgBqiyL3kcliP4AsnuXhY15w66omf0zP3md9JcWj0p2T3WOrNI8lQqM45jVtpBAV6Vy7UfM-I_3iSgUYVmHxhve6xPc1N1qrA&amp;theater   <b>We might as well have canned responses when talking about weather.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “It’s dry heat.” “It’s a desert.” “Under 70 degrees?

<h3><b>Things we want you to know</b></h3>
<p><b>We have all the biomes of the world in our state.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> From the San Francisco Peaks tundra to the arid desert everyone imagines we live in, diverse landscapes can be found all throughout Arizona – including one of the Seven Wonders of the World.

<p><b>We’re home to the best pizza city in America.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Phoenix earned the title in 2017 for promoting peace and respect for pizza of all forms, while Chicago and New York have yet to call a truce for the sake of our taste buds. At least, that sounds about right. We’re also pretty proud to be home to all locations of </span><a href="http://www.pizzeriabianco.com/welcome"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pizzeria Bianco</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, owned by </span><a href="https://www.eater.com/2015/3/10/8155543/pizzeria-bianco-best-pizza-america"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the nation’s best pizza maker</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><b>We have REALLY good Mexican food, too.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Living near Mexico has its tortilla-wrapped, salsa-smothered, spice-infused perks. Unfortunately, we become burrito snobs when we visit other states, but it’s all worth it when you can live and work right by places like </span><a href="http://www.phxburritohouse.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PHX Burrito House</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and find ultimately authentic places like </span><a href="http://www.tacarbon.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ta Carbon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><em>Guest blog by Michael Zimmerlich of 80/20 Records</em></p>
<p>2018 is a big year for me as it marks 10 years since 80/20 Records was formed.  It’s incredible to think how far I’ve come and yet still how much I have to learn.  But I’ve certainly learned a lot since I’ve started.  As I look back, here are some revelations about staying in business for 10 years.</p>
<h4>Be adaptive</h4>
<p>80/20 Records functions very differently now than it did 10 years ago, or even a year ago.  It’s a constant change of discovering what is working and, more importantly, what isn’t working.</p>
<p>During the first year, I decided to offer management services to one of my artists that extended what I did for them on the record label, which turned into a nightmare.  Last year, I re-thought on how I could provide this to artists and launched a management arm of 80/20 Records, which so far has been very successful on many levels.</p>
<p>For eight years, my company was a side-hustle and I had a full-time job.  When I quit my day job to focus on my company, I moved in with my parents and cut my personal expenses.  I’ve also looked into other ways I could make money on the side that wasn’t as demanding on my time, such as crowdfunding consulting, ghostwriting, creating one-page website templates for artists and more.  Now, I’m focused on building management while maintaining the record label.</p>
<p>If I didn’t adapt to how the music industry was changing, as well as how my personal life was changing, I would’ve shut the doors of 80/20 Records a long time ago.</p>
<h4>You can’t do it alone</h4>
<p>Everyone needs help and I’m certainly no exception.  I’m a co-founder of 80/20 Records, and my partner at the time had a big part on the philosophies of the company we created together that are still a part of the label today.  In fact, my brother was a partner for a while, as well.  He brought infrastructure to the company that I never had before that I still use today.</p>
<p>Every artist I ever represented took a risk on me and my company, which wouldn’t exist without them.  I’ve had 16 interns that contributed in countless ways, everything from taking care of merchandise at shows to social media.  Not to mention all of my colleagues that I’ve met over the years that opened opportunities to me, provided incredible advice, or offered their friendship.  I’m extremely grateful for every single person that has helped me over the past 10 years.</p>
<h4>Be kind to everyone</h4>
<p>Cannot stress this enough.  There is no question in my mind that the reason I’m still in business after 10 years is how I treat others.  Anyone from the artists to my interns to my fellow colleagues, I try as hard as I can to treat them with respect and friendliness.  I make sure to show my gratitude for those who helped me and to pay it forward as often as I can to others.  This is a long-term investment into yourself and your community.</p>
<p>I’ve had falling outs with some of my artists, but I kept it professional and kept in touch with many of them.  In fact, one of my first artists contacted me after three years and apologized on how they handled things.  Most of my business comes from referrals from previous clients, artists and colleagues, who obviously wouldn’t have recommended me if I didn’t do my job and treat them well.  Your community is much smaller than you think and word gets around, both good and bad.</p>
<h4>It’s better to try and fail than not to try at all</h4>
<p>Before I started 80/20 Records, I never worked in the music industry.  I never did an internship with a music business company.  I never took a single music business class.  Instead, I bought two books: one on music business law and the other on record label marketing.  From the record label marketing book, I took note of what I could do, what I couldn’t do and what I thought was just stupid so was going to do something else.  I wanted to run a record label the way I thought it would be run.</p>
<p>My very first artist was a friend of mine that made electronic music.  I found a sample contract in the record label marketing book that I had him sign.  Then did a Google search on how to get your music on iTunes.  This is how I started 80/20 Records, I just…did it.</p>
<p>Things will never ever be perfect.  There will always be something that can be improved upon, but if you wait, you’ll never release anything.  I’ve had artist sign contracts that could’ve been clearer, hosted events that could’ve been planned better, launched marketing campaigns that could’ve been executed better.  But if I didn’t act, it would’ve taken so much longer to do these things.  As a result, I failed a lot.  I’ve lost money on events, lost artists cause I could’ve handled situations better, opportunities that slipped through my fingers.  But none of that would’ve happened if I didn’t just go for it and see what happens.  Life is too short to wonder what if this goes wrong.</p>
<h4>In conclusion</h4>
<p>Probably most important of all is to love what you’re doing.  It’s going to be a pain at times, chances are you’ll probably get stressed out or depressed, but in the end if you endure the bad times to appreciate the good times, then you know you have something worth fighting for.  I like to put it &#8220;if you don’t mind the ‘BS,’ then you know you found your place.&#8221; I love every single minute of what I do.  And I look forward to the next 10 years.</p>

<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>80/20 Records is an independent record label and management company based in Phoenix, AZ.</p>
<p>With over 10 years of experience in the music industry, Mike has been involved with 15 album releases, as well as several music videos. The artists he’s personally represented have opened for acts such as George Clinton and the Parliament Funkadelic, The Mighty Mighty Bosstones, Twenty One Pilots, Catfish and the Bottlemen, Maroon 5, Capital Cities, Phantogram, MR MS, Animal Collective and Beck.</p>
<p>To help raise funds to record albums for artists on 80/20 Records led him into crowdfunding. He successfully raised over $10,000 for his first campaign.  Since then, he’s helped several campaigns successfully reach their goal amounts and now advise others to achieve the same. To date, the campaigns Mike has assisted with raised over $130,000. <!--codes_iframe--></p></div>

Whereas microwave meals and fast food once saw their heyday in the office, and campfires were all the craze among busy Neanderthals, modern entrepreneur meals are bringing creative phrases to coworking spaces before the words even hit the dictionary:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I had work during Friendsgiving, but my coworker got turducken on Grubhub.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Just used UberEATS to order a gluten-free nitro cold brew straight to my desk.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Did you know Postmates delivers poke bowls and venti Frappuccinos?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As innovators who #GSD, we at CO+HOOTS love seeing tech meet food, almost as much as we love having food meet our taste buds. But sometimes, it’s an experience and affordability you’re after — not convenience and delivery fees. Here’s a list of some of our go-to local spots near CO+HOOTS to ensure deliciousness is accessible to you any time:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Breakfast/Brunch</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Breakfast is the most important meal of the day, but if you miss it, you’re in luck. </span><b><a href="http://goclarendon.com/restaurant/">Café Tranquilo</a> (0.5 mi)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is within walking distance and </span><b><a href="http://famephx.com/">fàme caffe</a> (1.2 mi)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a short bike ride away, and both serve breakfast all day long. We recommend the chilaquiles — at both locations — for the unique versions of a classic Latin American dish.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you love social enterprises like us, </span><b><a href="http://therefugeaz.com/">The Refuge Cafe</a> (1.7 mi)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is for you. A bikeable distance away, it supports local charities with every cup of coffee you purchase! We also love bettering the environment by grabbing a good Black and White from </span><b><a href="http://www.luxcoffee.com/">Lux Central</a> (0.8 mi)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which is accessible on foot, bike and the light rail — no need to drive. Lux is always open until midnight or later, but when you need to pull through a true all-nighter, </span><b><a href="https://urbanbeans.com/">Urban Beans</a> (0.6 mi) </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">is open 24/7 with the best all-vegan toasted marshmallow lattes around.</span></p>

<h3><b>Dinner</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Macayo’s used to be right next to us. Now, </span><b><a href="http://www.macayo.com/">Woody’s Macayo</a> (0.2 mi)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is still basically right next to us. Did you know we ate 789 mini chimis in a year once? You could say we’re pretty satisfied — even though we’re always saving room to have chocolate chimis for dessert.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pho is just as close to Cohootian hearts. It was the center of our second longest general Slack discussion of 2017, which has crowned </span><b><a href="http://thuphonoodles.com/">Pho Noodles</a> (0.7 mi) </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">as the undisputed champion of local pho. Looking for the Italian kind of noodle? Take the light rail to Central and Camelback to head into </span><b><a href="http://www.saucepizzaandwine.com/">Sauce Pizza &amp; Wine</a> (1.4 mi)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">always</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> get the All Natural Strawberry-Basil Lemonade.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And there’s no way we can go to </span><b><a href="http://www.ocotillophx.com/">Ocotillo</a> (0.5 mi)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which also has a coffee bar open in the mornings, TOO many times. Once you go there, you’ll never want to leave. The only time we do is when they close. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Dessert</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our sweet tooth is never too far from us. You can easily bike from CO+HOOTS to two of our favorite shops with no time wasted. </span><b><a href="http://churnaz.com/">Churn</a> (1.6 mi)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> offers fresh ice cream selections — order the S’mores Sundae to bring the blowtorch out — while </span><b><a href="http://tsoynami.com/">Nami</a> (1.8 mi)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> offers delectable vegan pastries and tSoynami soft serve.</span></p>

<h3><b>Bar</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the end of a long day, we all know you deserve a drink. You don’t need to travel too far. </span><b><a href="https://www.thecleverkoi.com/">The Clever Koi</a> (0.6 mi) </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">is more than a ramen haven, as it offers drinks that range from craft cocktails and wine to beer and sake. For a wider selection of beers, we suggest </span><b><a href="http://www.hussbrewing.com/">Huss Brewing Company’s Uptown Phoenix Taproom</a> (1.5 mi)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, where the famous Koffee Kölsch is just two light rail stops up.

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p>Over the past semester, I had the opportunity to intern at CO+HOOTS out of midtown Phoenix. I had never had an internship before with any company, let alone a company so unique, and I was eager for the next months ahead of me. What I gained from my experience was something I would have never expected, and something I would never trade.</p>
<h4>CO+mmunity</h4>
<p>I had never heard of anything like CO+HOOTS before, let alone had the chance to work in such a space. I was intrigued by the idea of coworking in a community that fostered collaboration. It seemed like a mouthful, but I was excited to see just what it meant. From my short time at CO+HOOTS, I was able to learn not only what it meant to be in a community, but also what it means to belong to a community. From brief conversations with members in the kitchen, to getting to know businesses and entrepreneurs within the work space, I learned that there is always someone willing to teach you something if you make the time to learn.</p>
<h4>CO+llaboration</h4>
<p>I have found in other jobs I previously had that not everyone was willing to work or listen to someone new to the workforce that had little relevant experience to offer; this was NOT the case when I came to CO+HOOTS. Immediately, my ideas and opinions were welcomed, and even taken into consideration on projects big and small. My skills were put to use in ways that I wouldn’t have thought of on my own. I was given the chance to collaborate alongside other interns, as well as industry professionals, with the skills and connections made from the networking given to me by CO+HOOTS.</p>
<h4>CO+work &amp; CO+care</h4>
<p>When I came to CO+HOOTS, I was pleasantly surprised by how comfortable I felt from my very first visit. I was welcomed by friendly faces and down-to-earth people that I could connect with on a business and personal level. As a typical college student, I have a lot on my plate and am pretty overwhelmed a majority of the time. When I was having a bad day (okay, bad week), I was able to go to my supervisors and express my frustrations with school, work and just life in general. It felt good knowing that I worked with people that actually cared about my well-being and how I was doing when I was outside the office, too.</p>
<p>From my time at CO+HOOTS, I learned an indescribable amount of life lessons about business, entrepreneurship, networking and what it means to have a friend. As my time at CO+HOOTS comes to a close, I can’t help but think of what fellow intern Bryce Manhardt likes to remind us of from The Lego Movie: “Everything is awesome when you’re part of a team.” Although my time with the team has come to a close, I know I’ll be able to call upon anyone of them whenever I need a helping hand. <!--codes_iframe--></p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><span>When choosing a career path, whether it be for the first time or fifth time, it can be overwhelming. Whether you are a recent college grad, high school senior or experienced industry professional, there can be so many directions to go, you may not know which way is up after a while. CO+HOOTS member Steven Rudolph said it best when he compared it to going to an ice cream shop: “There are too many choices. You don’t know which type of ice cream to choose.”</span></p>
<p><span>This is the very dilemma Steven set out to solve with his company <a href="http://www.multiplenatures.com/">Multiple Natures</a>. He said the aim of the company “is to help people identify their potential and to align it with the work that they do so they get greater fulfillment and success, life balance and direction.” It was after a journey practically around the world that Steven was able to not only discover his love of teaching, but also “(find in his) own evolution that (he is) good at finding other people,” as well.</span></p>
<p><span>His journey would begin with his undergraduate degree from the University of Florida, where he would then move to New York City in a hope to find “fame and fortune as a rockstar.” As all authentic rockstars start off, Steven got a job to help pay the bills, but what would happen next would ultimately change his career path altogether. This part-time job? Teaching. </span></p>
<p><span>“I fell in love… in my first classes and I thought, ‘How come nobody ever told me about teaching?’ I didn’t know I had this ability,” Steven said. </span></p>
<p><span>This would begin the trek across the world, which took Steven to Japan and then India, where he would create Jiva Public School. What started with eight children grew to more than 2,000 and over his 20 years spent in India, other schools picked it up. </span></p>
<p><span>“The core of the program is that every child has to do some introspection, figure out what their strengths are and make the decisions for their course of study,” Steven said.</span></p>
<p><span>Steven would then advance to Europe, taking on France, Switzerland and Lithuania. He created a program where “people were choosing the course and direction of their life based on who they were.” People everywhere have been choosing it for the different experience it brings, so much so that the website is offered in three languages: English, French and even Lithuanian. </span></p>
<p><span>He soon knew it was time to build it out. That’s when he decided it was time to move back to the U.S. and fully build Multiple Natures to scale.</span></p>
<p><span>Mentor and friend Francine Hardaway had been selling the city of Phoenix to Steven for years before the move back to the States, but was able to officially convince him after his first visit to CO+HOOTS. Steven said Francine told him, “Don’t even start thinking about apartments. The first thing you go do is you drive over to CO+HOOTS right now, and you meet Odeen and Jenny, and you get yourself a desk there. Then, once you’ve got your place, then you find an apartment and you’ll see everything will fall into place.”</span></p>
<p><span>Heeding her advice, Steven made the journey to midtown and realized CO+HOOTS is where he needed to be. </span></p>
<p><span>“It gave me a beautiful, energetic, focused environment that enabled me to feel instantly at home, with respect to my business and my work,” Steven said. “There was no friction here. When I sat at my desk, I felt energized by the other people who are around the community that’s here, which is very supportive. It gave me a grounding and insights into the entrepreneurial scene.”</span></p>
<p><span>Multiple Natures has been able to “create tools that are best in class…for working with clients in the process of identification and alignment of potential.” In this, the company has been able to help countless people in finding the right career path for them. Being a part of the CO+HOOTS community has provided Steven with the chance to not only help others in solving their own ice cream dilemmas, but serve as a valuable asset to the community and fellow entrepreneurs. </span> <!--codes_iframe--></p></div>

<p><span>Sampson isn’t just your average lovable brown-eyed boy — he’s legendary around the office for stealing hearts. If you have the opportunity to sit down with Sampson he would probably tell you “hav-hav” followed by a sniff, which is his polite way of asking for a belly rub. I was lucky enough to sit down with Sampson and ask him a few questions. </span></p>
<p><span>I started off by asking, “Are you a morning person or a night person?” He responded with a laugh and sneeze, reminding me he actually isn’t a person at all. I could feel his sense of humor melting my heart already. When I asked Sampson the most embarrassing thing that’s ever happened to him, he recalled the time he was playing fetch with <a href="http://thegreydesign.com">Grey Design</a> founder Ashley Marshall (his human) and he jumped up to catch a toy, but had the timing all wrong: “Bow wow ouch to say the least.”</span></p>
<p><span>Sampson and I decided to take a walk around the CO+HOOTS office. The more we walked around the more starstruck I felt. While being greeted and pet by his numerous fans, I asked Sampson if he could speak another language, what he would choose. He answered immediately with French. I asked him what made him pick the Language of Love so confidently, and he told me he wanted to flirt with all the belles of the office. Classic Sampson. I wrapped up my time with Sampson by asking him the timeless question, “Who’s a good boy?” We both knew, without question, it’s him.    </span></p>
<p><b><i><img class="size-medium wp-image-13435 alignleft" src="https://cohoots.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/21105438_1635842979790442_5192679524255840277_n-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" />Chloe:</i></b></p>
<p><span>If you’re looking to meet the queen of the CO+HOOTS office, look no further than Chloe, our favorite German Shepherd. On an average day, you can find Chloe hangin’ out with the gang at <a href="https://www.ackmanndickenson.com/">Ackmann &amp; Dickenson</a> and enjoying the air conditioning. If Chloe lets you give her a good pet, you won’t be disappointed; in fact, if you smell your hand afterwards, you’ll be pleasantly surprised. </span></p>
<p><span>I started by asking Chloe what the weirdest nickname she’s ever had was. She gave it some thought, but then told me it was “Stop Chewing That” and that she had no clue why she was called that. I could see there was more than meets the surface with Chloe and wondered what made her so special. I asked her if there was something she disliked with no good reason for disliking it. She gave me an “arf-arf,” which clearly meant Macadamia nuts, and I couldn’t agree more myself. </span></p>
<p><span>As it turns out, this wasn’t the only thing Chloe and I have in common. She is also a Virgo. I wondered just how seriously Chloe took her horoscope, and she told me she doesn&#8217;t even consider her day to have started until she checks it. I asked Chloe if she would be willing to share her favorite quote with the readers of CO+HOOTS,  she shared with me the following by Chris Rock: “Ruff-ruff *double pant, sniff, a big ole tail wag* ruuufff: ruf,” or loosely translated, “There are only three things women need in life: food, water and compliments.” If you get the opportunity to sit down with Chloe, I two paws up would recommend. </span></p>
<p><b><i><img class="size-medium wp-image-13438 alignright" src="https://cohoots.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Piper-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" />Piper:</i></b></p>
<p><span>Piper, aka Mr. Congeniality, is a lovable, huggable, ball of joy in the Wired PR office in CO+HOOTS. If you don’t catch Piper around the office, there’s a good chance he’s at CrossFit or doing an Agility workout, which he would recommend highly. I got the chance to sit down with Piper and I quickly learned why he is one of the most popular dogs in the office. </span></p>
<p><span>His secretary and owner Beth Cochran, co-founder of <a href="https://wiredprgroup.com/">Wired PR</a>, was able to squeeze me into his busy schedule and in return, I gave him a good back rub. The first thing I noticed were his impeccable muscles and how loose they are. He told me it’s all due to his Tempur-Pedic dog bed; in fact, he never travels without it. I asked Piper if there was something he did as a puppy he wishes he could still do. He gave it some thought and even chewed on <a href="https://www.mypetneedsthat.com/best-bones-for-dogs/">his bone</a> a moment before telling us he wished he could still sit in Mom’s (Beth’s) lap while she worked, as it was the only place comfier than his world-renowned bed.</span></p>
<p><span>Piper went on to tell me that he is 7 years old, but doesn’t feel a day over 3 in spirit. I wondered, was there something or someone that kept his saged spirit so young at heart? Piper told me it was a combination of “bark ruffff *sniff*” — or listening to the soundtrack for the “Wicked”</span> <span>musical, a good back rub and calcium-enriched dogbone every day — that did him wonders; personally, I can’t wait to try it. </span></p>
<p><span>I decided to wrap up my time with Piper by asking him where he sees himself over the next three years. Piper told me he looks forward to continuing to come to work at Wired PR and the CO+HOOTS office, eventually becoming the Chief Executive Officer of the company. If you want an intelligent and heartfelt conversation, look no further than the joy that is Piper.</span></p>
<p><b><i><img class="size-medium wp-image-13437 alignleft" src="https://cohoots.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/19620408_1571105439597530_8226931699353656750_o-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" />Herbey:</i></b></p>
<p><span>Herbey, the curious jester of the CO+HOOTS office and Piper’s Wired PR coworker, will be quick to greet you and even quicker to give you a helping hand. Don’t let his short legs fool you — this little tank makes up in hospitality what he lacks in height. </span></p>
<p><span>When I asked him what he likes to do outside of the office, he told me he enjoys the occasional long walk on the beach, but he also loves sitting on his office throne. Knowing he was adopted around six months ago, I asked him if he believes that everything happens for a reason or if we create reasons for the things that happen. He nuzzled my arm with love and said everything does happen for a reason; sometimes we just don’t know the reason. My heart felt as warm as the September heat outside. </span></p>
<p><span>I tasked Herbey if he could dive into a pool filled with anything, what it would be. He told me, “hav-hav, *tail wag*” </span><i><span>or</span></i><span> “*tongue drool* bark.” I could see his ultimatum. I know I would have a hard time choosing between a pool of throw pillows or a kale and spinach salad bar, as well. I’ve met many veggie fans in my life, but few that enjoy them as much as Herbey; however, Herbey did admit he enjoys eating just about everything. </span></p>
<p><span>I then wondered who his celebrity inspiration was. Herbey blushed a little and confided it was Bullseye, the dog from the Target commercials. I could tell he and I would get along fabulously. Before ending my visit with Herbey, I asked him if he had any must-watch movie or TV show recommendations. He said he never misses a week of “America’s Got Talent,” but is always looking for someone to watch it with him and help in voting for his favorite acts due to his lack of opposable thumbs. If you can’t wait until Wednesday for a pick-me-up MidWeek MindTweak, talk to Herbey and satisfy all your mood-boosting needs.     </span> <!--codes_iframe--></p></div>
