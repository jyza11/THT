<p>CO+HOOTS has always believed businesses in the community have a voice and should use that voice to take a stance. We are a part of the community and strive to uphold our community’s values and basic rights. As a minority-owned organization that is deeply rooted in diversity and inclusion with a mission to support the underrepresented, CO+HOOTS stands in solidarity with Black communities and recognizes the pressing significance and necessity of the #BlackLivesMatter movement. As a stakeholder in the health of our community’s economy, we know our innovation ecosystem would not thrive without the leading-edge contributions of our Black community.</p>
<p>Our hearts are hurting and furious over the continuing acts of violence against our Black communities in the United States, and most recently, the senseless murders of Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery and George Floyd. May they rest in peace, love and power. True justice must be served. This isn’t about minimizing other communities&#8217; struggles. Those need to be uplifted, too. But the long history of police violence against Black communities is just part of the immense breadth of injustices Black communities experience in this country, no matter the system.</p>
<p>Our hearts hurt, but our spirit isn’t broken. There is so much that can be done to become better allies,  spread awareness and take action to disrupt racial injustices. We hope you join us. We will be sharing what we all can do to become a better ally at whatever level you are currently comfortable in, such as listening to, uplifting and amplifying Black voices and experiences; and confronting racial injustices you encounter in your professional and personal networks even when uncomfortable, especially among family and friends.</p>

</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>REOPENING PLAN &#8211; STARTING MAY 18, 2020</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we think about what the future of our community looks like, CO+HOOTS is approaching our reopening focused on keeping all CO+HOOTIANS safe. While our community interactions may look a little different than before, we are taking the necessary steps to care for all of our collective wellbeing with you at the center of it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social distancing may be part of our new normal, but collaboration and connection remain more important than ever—and having a safe place to do that is essential. First and foremost, we want our community to feel safe enough to come in and work together and still feel comfortable being with friends and family outside of work. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s why we are working tirelessly to evaluate our space and prepare it for reopening. We are taking measures to ensure distancing measures and sanitization protocols are in place to protect all CO+HOOTians. But, we need your help too. The wellbeing of our community depends on all of us to do our part. </span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Our Space</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">We are making space and services updates to maintain hygiene safety and physical distancing best practices in three ways:</span></p>
<p><b style="font-size: 20px;">Prioritizing personal space:</b><span style="font-size: 20px;"> By modifying shared spaces with staggered seating and buffer zones, members can continue to operate while still maintaining a healthy physical distance from fellow members.</span></p>
<p><b>OUR ACTION: </b></p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have put down visual markers to designate 6’ distance</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have rearranged our open space to stagger seating, so please mind the signs and leave furniture in its place</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flex/Open spots have also been redesigned/redistributed to allow for safe work distance</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have opened up our classroom space as an overflow area, feel free to take your lunch or call in this space and sit in a designated spot</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Increased sanitization:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> We are disinfecting common areas more frequently and are providing sanitization products in our spaces.</span></p>
<p><b>OUR RESPONSE:</b></p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have brought on our favorite facility man, Pilo to come daily and disinfect all areas</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our team will wipe all high-touch surfaces daily as well</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have added hand sanitizer and alcohol wipes throughout the space, please wipe down any space after you use it</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have installed door openers that you can open with your foot on phone room doors, bathrooms and front door to minimize exposure to high touch points</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><b style="font-size: 20px;">Behavioral signage: </b><span style="font-size: 20px;">New cleaning standards and capacity protocols will be posted throughout the space as friendly reminders to members and staff to keep our space safe.</span><span style="font-size: 20px;"> </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Our People, Our Community</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Starting May 18, we are requiring that everyone must wear masks at CO+HOOTS.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wearing a mask is one of the most effective ways we can stop the spread in our communities. You can read more about that at the following link: </span><a href="https://bit.ly/whywearamask"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://bit.ly/whywearamask</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is a simple step we all can take to minimize our risk to one another. We wear masks to protect you, and we need you to wear a mask to protect us and the entire CO+HOOTS community. Moving forward, we are adopting a zero tolerance policy regarding masks. If you arrive without one, you will be asked to leave and return when properly equipped.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order for us to safely reopen, we must come together as a community and adopt these necessary measures to protect one another. We’re doing our best to set up the office with the needed supplies and create proper distancing in our shared spaces, but it won’t be effective unless you do your part too. That means wearing a mask, wiping down the areas you work in, respecting others&#8217; physical space, and not coming in if you don’t feel well.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The Plan</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are committed to protecting our staff and community members by taking a phased approach to reopening.

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><em>The days of remote positions being purely underpaid telemarketing jobs are gone.</em></p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.studyfinds.org/survey-one-five-office-employees-work-remotely/">One in five people work remotely</a> and over 50% of workers say their company has a work from home policy. What this remote work trend has created is an entirely new workplace lifestyle <em>and a chance for diversification like we have never seen before.</em></p>
<h3>With the ability to recruit from all over the world, we’re in the middle of two major shifts in the workforce.</h3>
<p><strong>Shift One:</strong> Companies have access to talent regardless of location</p>
<p><strong>Shift Two:</strong> Remote workers are having healthier and happier work experiences</p>
<p>InVision, a digital design platform, is looking toward the future and capitalizing on these shifts. They run an entire 700-person team fully remote — and they have been doing so for seven years.</p>
<p>InVision’s Chief People Officer, Mark Frein, told <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/invision-startup-all-employees-work-remotely-2018-9">Business Insider</a> he firmly believes hiring from any location gives InVision an edge as a technology company. Frein isn’t limited to finding talent in New York City and has diversified his workforce to talent around the world. He’s capitalizing on the statistics that show the value of remote workers (<a href="https://biz30.timedoctor.com/remote-workers-infographic/">click here for an infographic on remote work statistics</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li>Ninety-one percent of remote workers get more work done outside of the office</li>
<li>Remote workers are happier with their work than office workers</li>
<li>Remote workers feel more valued at work than office workers</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>“It’s about results, not where your IP address is. We care about what you’re able to do or achieve.” Mark Frein</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Companies like Basecamp, GitLab, Buffer and Splice have also embraced a fully remote team. Basecamp’s founder Jason Fried, transcribed his remote working business strategy into a best-selling book in 2009, <em>Rework</em>. In his book, he explained how remote work was an integral part of his company’s success.</p>
<p><strong>With only a remote team, Fried has amassed over three million Basecamp users.</strong></p>
<p>As the founder of <a href="https://cohoots.com/">CO+HOOTS</a>, a nationally ranked coworking office based in Phoenix, I watch business owners capitalize on having remote teams on a daily basis.</p>
<p>When it comes to innovation and closing business deals, the businesses capitalizing on the freedom that remote work provides are winning.</p>
<p><strong>The future of the workforce is here and this is how to capitalize on the opportunity of remote work.</strong></p>
<h3>Work Environment Will Be A Priority</h3>
<p>When working remotely, the work environment can vary from a table in a coffee shop, to a desk in a local library. Or, for some, it can be sitting in pajamas on the living room couch with your trusty cat pawing at your arm.</p>
<p>Josh Johnson, Senior Product Manager at Dribbble, runs a 50-person remote team from a coworking office. His experience with a remote team taught him that work environments aren’t a cookie cutter template, but a functioning part of an employee’s life. If employers can provide employees with the chance to find the optimal work environment, employers become catalyst to their employees’ health, productivity and longevity instead of inhibitors to their potential.</p>
<p><em>“No single way to work is appropriate for everyone. Some people are mentally and emotionally drained by sitting in a bustling, open office environment for nine hours every day. Others feel the same way about sitting alone at a desk in their home. Some people need to get away from their house to focus and be productive, others are happiest when they can take a 2pm conference call and enjoy a quick after school snack with their kids at 3pm.</em></p>
<p><em>We all win when we stop having tweet wars over which way is better and realize that the best possible job market is one that provides diverse opportunities to all types of people in all types of situations.”</em></p>
<p>The future of remote work depends on employers supporting their employees work productivity, no matter what form it takes.</p>
<p>Companies should take an interest in their employees’ remote office. Some are now providing laptops or a desktop computer. Others are giving stipends for home office furniture like standing desks. Even scheduling a weekly grocery delivery order to keep remote employees energized and healthy.</p>
<h3>Lower Overhead than Traditional Office Space</h3>
<p>All businesses are looking to create higher levels of happiness and lower their bottom line. Very rarely has the two ever come in one package, that is until coworking came around. Coworking space memberships often start at only $99 a month for individuals and allows companies to scale their team quickly and efficiently. This includes fast Wifi, utilities, office equipment, cleaning fees, access to networking events, free parking and more. Not to mention the biggest benefit — helping employees not feel so isolated. The overhead of a typical office is upwards of $3,000 not inclusive of all the utilities, maintenance, furniture and taxes. Keeping employees happy? Priceless.</p>
<p>Josh Padnick of Phoenix-based <a href="https://www.gruntwork.io/">Gruntwork</a> employs 14 remote workers and offers coworking as an employee benefit.</p>
<p><em>“We pay for everyone on our team to use a coworking space if they wish, and about half our team uses the benefit. The reality is that working from home all day every day, and then remaining at home at night can be draining and uninteresting. We also crave the in-person human connection and serendipity that comes from being in a physical workplace. Coworking is a great way to provide these things. You get the physical community, and yet your coworkers are distributed.”</em></p>
<p>Josh (full disclosure: he is a member at CO+HOOTS) spends 80% less revenue on office space than a traditional team does. When these savings are redirected to employee health and training, as well as business development, we see why remote teams are able to scale so quickly. Most spaces offer free trials for a day or a week, which give remote employees the opportunity to decide whether to see if being around other highly efficient workers helps them feel more efficient.</p>
<p>Coworking spaces are the done-for-you office space with professional development built in.</p>
<h3>Work Will No Longer Be 9–5</h3>
<p>The idea of the 9–5 work week is becoming less and less popular among employers. We’re finally realizing, <em>it’s not necessary.</em></p>
<p>Richard Branson recently wrote a piece <a href="https://www.virgin.com/richard-branson/way-we-all-work-going-change">on the future of the workplace</a>: “five days a week with two day weekends and a few weeks of holiday each year has become ingrained in society. However, it wasn’t always the case, and it won’t be in the future.”</p>
<p>Virgin happily applies an atypical work week with its employees and allows them to take off two months if they believe they need to.</p>
<p>The typical work schedule is an antiquated idea of how businesses should run. In most cases, there is no need for an employee to come in at a set period. Even more so, it would bode well for their health if they didn’t. Commuting to a job during “rush hour” is becoming increasingly stressful. Missing out on picking kids up for school does not equate to a great work-life balance. We have as a society switched from working hard to working smart and becoming a workforce that values measuring results over measuring time. It makes sense that 9–5 is dead.</p>
<h3>Hire for Diverse Opinions and Cultural Backgrounds</h3>
<p>What if each problem in your business was looked at by three experts with various backgrounds? Instead of getting the same answer three times, you’d have a variant of answers depending on the past experience of your experts.</p>
<p>The location agnostic factor of remote work means each of your experts stands on a different foundation. They all know the same information and can implement the same strategies but they may come to the project with three perspectives, three prior experiences and three ideas on solving any roadblocks along the way.</p>
<p>Diversity of opinions and cultural backgrounds is what Stephen Olmstead, Chief of Staff at <a href="https://www.invisionapp.com/">InVision</a>, attributes to the team’s ability to problem solve.</p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p>Working with 700 people from around the world means that Stephen’s team isn’t built on the foundation of one person’s experience. It’s built on the foundation of 700. Which foundation sounds sturdier?</p>
<p><strong>The future of the workforce is going to consist of happier workers that are location independent and aren’t hindered by their socioeconomic status, gender or race.</strong></p>
<p>Companies will enjoy the benefits reaped when workers aren’t forced to show up to an uninspiring cubicle-laden dungeon with barely any windows after sitting in hours of traffic. They’ll see more innovation by hopping on a Zoom call for a team meeting and seeing the variety of faces on the screen, all with new experiences and ideas from their varying locations of the world.</p>
<p>Companies comprised of an inclusive and diverse workforce that supports happy workers is the future of work we all deserve.</p>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p>Getting started as an entrepreneur can seem like a daunting task, but taking initiative and being willing to learn can lead to a chain reaction of incredible results. We built our internship program to help students reach their entrepreneurial goals, regardless of industry, and gain a community of supporters to help them succeed. We&#8217;re proud to bring on board a new ninja intern who exemplifies the proactive spirit of entrepreneurship.</p>
<h3>Meet Jeron Artest</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-15616" src="https://cohoots.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_6676-1024x683.jpg" alt="Jeron Artest ninja intern" width="456" height="304" /></p>
<p>Jeron Artest joins our team as our new nintern for the fall and spring semesters, and we can&#8217;t wait to see what he accomplishes.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re already incredibly impressed by Jeron&#8217;s wisdom and determination, and he&#8217;s already on his way toward his major career goals. He is a high school student who already knows how to code, recently traveled to China to further his basketball dreams and is committed to achieving the goals he has set for himself.</p>
<h5>His goals:</h5>
<ul>
<li>Learn how to work within a team in an office</li>
<li>Work on different projects to improve/hone programming skills and learn new skills</li>
<li>Networking with others in the same/similar field</li>
<li>Event planning</li>
</ul>
<h5>Why he wanted to work at CO+HOOTS:</h5>
<p>I wanted to work at CO+HOOTS to personally experience the inner workings of a business while also being exposed to other businesses at the same time. It&#8217;s just such a perfect experience. Also, I like dogs, and there are a lot of office dogs here.</p>
<h5>What he believes makes a community successful:</h5>
<p>A community is successful when everyone supports each other unconditionally, whether it&#8217;s by pointing them towards the right direction or personally assisting each other.</p>
<h5>Why he believes being proactive at a young age is important:</h5>
<p>By being proactive at a &#8220;young&#8221; age, you&#8217;ll make your life easier. It&#8217;s like procrastinating on an assignment. If you do it too late, it might not be as good as if you did it early. Being proactive doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean finding a job right now or taking extra hard classes. It can be as simple as going to meetups, or contacting people on LinkedIn or even Twitter. It all benefits your future without all the stress of being an adult.</p>
<h3>Five tips for students to reach their goals by Jeron</h3>
<p>At CO+HOOTS, we believe that age does not have to be a barrier to achieving big goals. We support our our nonprofit arm <a href="http://cohootsfdn.org">CO+HOOTS Foundation</a>&#8216;s efforts to help high school students like Jeron bring their ideas to life at <a href="http://ycmsummit.com">Youth Changemaker Summit</a> and beyond. Sometimes, achieving goals starts with a few simple actions, including these tips written by Jeron:</p>
<p>1. Learn all the things. Any knowledge is the best knowledge.</p>
<p>2. Do what you love so you make the most of your time.</p>
<p>3. Find people who have similar interests to yours. Networks are important.</p>
<p>4. Communicate. It helps everyone around you and yourself understand what&#8217;s going on.</p>
<p>5. Write down your goals and a rough roadmap you can take to reach them.</p>
<h3>Jeron beyond the coworking space</h3>
<h5>Hometown:</h5>
<p>I was born in New York, New York, but I consider home to be Los Angeles.</p>
<h5>What are your own personal hopes and dreams?</h5>
<ul>
<li>Become an entrepreneur</li>
<li>Own several (mainly software-based) businesses; creating/exiting; repeat</li>
<li>Turn current concepts into actual revenue-generating businesses</li>
<li>Become an NBA player</li>
</ul>
<h5>What should the CO+HOOTS community know about you?</h5>
<p>I love trying new types of food. I always try to find a unique place to eat wherever I travel.</p>
<h5>What is one thing people don&#8217;t know about you?</h5>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><em>Guest blog by Michael Zimmerlich of 80/20 Records</em></p>
<p>2018 is a big year for me as it marks 10 years since 80/20 Records was formed.  It’s incredible to think how far I’ve come and yet still how much I have to learn.  But I’ve certainly learned a lot since I’ve started.  As I look back, here are some revelations about staying in business for 10 years.</p>
<h4>Be adaptive</h4>
<p>80/20 Records functions very differently now than it did 10 years ago, or even a year ago.  It’s a constant change of discovering what is working and, more importantly, what isn’t working.</p>
<p>During the first year, I decided to offer management services to one of my artists that extended what I did for them on the record label, which turned into a nightmare.  Last year, I re-thought on how I could provide this to artists and launched a management arm of 80/20 Records, which so far has been very successful on many levels.</p>
<p>For eight years, my company was a side-hustle and I had a full-time job.  When I quit my day job to focus on my company, I moved in with my parents and cut my personal expenses.  I’ve also looked into other ways I could make money on the side that wasn’t as demanding on my time, such as crowdfunding consulting, ghostwriting, creating one-page website templates for artists and more.  Now, I’m focused on building management while maintaining the record label.</p>
<p>If I didn’t adapt to how the music industry was changing, as well as how my personal life was changing, I would’ve shut the doors of 80/20 Records a long time ago.</p>
<h4>You can’t do it alone</h4>
<p>Everyone needs help and I’m certainly no exception.  I’m a co-founder of 80/20 Records, and my partner at the time had a big part on the philosophies of the company we created together that are still a part of the label today.  In fact, my brother was a partner for a while, as well.  He brought infrastructure to the company that I never had before that I still use today.</p>
<p>Every artist I ever represented took a risk on me and my company, which wouldn’t exist without them.  I’ve had 16 interns that contributed in countless ways, everything from taking care of merchandise at shows to social media.  Not to mention all of my colleagues that I’ve met over the years that opened opportunities to me, provided incredible advice, or offered their friendship.  I’m extremely grateful for every single person that has helped me over the past 10 years.</p>
<h4>Be kind to everyone</h4>
<p>Cannot stress this enough.  There is no question in my mind that the reason I’m still in business after 10 years is how I treat others.  Anyone from the artists to my interns to my fellow colleagues, I try as hard as I can to treat them with respect and friendliness.  I make sure to show my gratitude for those who helped me and to pay it forward as often as I can to others.  This is a long-term investment into yourself and your community.</p>
<p>I’ve had falling outs with some of my artists, but I kept it professional and kept in touch with many of them.  In fact, one of my first artists contacted me after three years and apologized on how they handled things.  Most of my business comes from referrals from previous clients, artists and colleagues, who obviously wouldn’t have recommended me if I didn’t do my job and treat them well.  Your community is much smaller than you think and word gets around, both good and bad.</p>
<h4>It’s better to try and fail than not to try at all</h4>
<p>Before I started 80/20 Records, I never worked in the music industry.  I never did an internship with a music business company.  I never took a single music business class.  Instead, I bought two books: one on music business law and the other on record label marketing.  From the record label marketing book, I took note of what I could do, what I couldn’t do and what I thought was just stupid so was going to do something else.  I wanted to run a record label the way I thought it would be run.</p>
<p>My very first artist was a friend of mine that made electronic music.  I found a sample contract in the record label marketing book that I had him sign.  Then did a Google search on how to get your music on iTunes.  This is how I started 80/20 Records, I just…did it.</p>
<p>Things will never ever be perfect.  There will always be something that can be improved upon, but if you wait, you’ll never release anything.  I’ve had artist sign contracts that could’ve been clearer, hosted events that could’ve been planned better, launched marketing campaigns that could’ve been executed better.  But if I didn’t act, it would’ve taken so much longer to do these things.  As a result, I failed a lot.  I’ve lost money on events, lost artists cause I could’ve handled situations better, opportunities that slipped through my fingers.  But none of that would’ve happened if I didn’t just go for it and see what happens.  Life is too short to wonder what if this goes wrong.</p>
<h4>In conclusion</h4>
<p>Probably most important of all is to love what you’re doing.  It’s going to be a pain at times, chances are you’ll probably get stressed out or depressed, but in the end if you endure the bad times to appreciate the good times, then you know you have something worth fighting for.  I like to put it &#8220;if you don’t mind the ‘BS,’ then you know you found your place.&#8221; I love every single minute of what I do.  And I look forward to the next 10 years.</p>

<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>80/20 Records is an independent record label and management company based in Phoenix, AZ.</p>
<p>With over 10 years of experience in the music industry, Mike has been involved with 15 album releases, as well as several music videos. The artists he’s personally represented have opened for acts such as George Clinton and the Parliament Funkadelic, The Mighty Mighty Bosstones, Twenty One Pilots, Catfish and the Bottlemen, Maroon 5, Capital Cities, Phantogram, MR MS, Animal Collective and Beck.</p>
<p>To help raise funds to record albums for artists on 80/20 Records led him into crowdfunding. He successfully raised over $10,000 for his first campaign.  Since then, he’s helped several campaigns successfully reach their goal amounts and now advise others to achieve the same. To date, the campaigns Mike has assisted with raised over $130,000. <!--codes_iframe--></p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><div>Connor Waslo is a social entrepreneur who is already working on his own startup before starting college. As he takes his proactive steps to ruling the world, we&#8217;re excited to give him hands-on experience with all that goes into building a business. In the words of Connor Waslo (please read in an stellar Australian accent), &#8220;CO+HOOTS has all of that!&#8221; And now we have him to teach us how to wiggle our ears.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>Get our nintern&#8217;s two cents on life before they&#8217;re worth one Bitcoin:</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><b>Hometown: </b>Phoenix, AZ</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><b>Why did you want to work at CO+HOOTS? </b></div>
<div><b> </b>I work best surrounded by social people and lively environments. CO+HOOTS has all of that! As I work on my own startup, I&#8217;ll take any opportunity I can to learn how businesses run and to meet people living my dream. Interning here is basically the perfect opportunity for me to move towards accomplishing all sorts of goals.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><b>What are your hopes and dreams at CO+HOOTS? </b></div>
<div>Fame, fortune, a team of my own interns. Just kidding. I want to meet as many people as I can and absorb as much advice as possible. Capitalizing on such a great learning experience is the ultimate goal.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><b>Members in CO+HOOTS may be able to help you as well… What are your own personal hopes and dreams?</b></div>
<div>I hope to run my own successful startup. Ideally, once I&#8217;ve found my unicorn, I can help other people run their startups as efficiently as possible. Entrepreneurship is such a fantastic skill and someday I want to help kids realize that they don&#8217;t have to work for anybody. They can work for themselves.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><b>If you had 100 billion dollars, you would… </b></div>
<div><b> </b>Invest in education and environmental preservation.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><b>What should the CO+HOOTS community know about you? </b></div>
<div>I love meeting with new people and picking their brain about business, programming, life or anything! I appreciate all sorts of perspectives and would love to meet all of you.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><b>What is one thing people don’t know about you? </b></div>
<div>I&#8217;m not Australian or Russian but I can talk in some pretty decent Australian and Russian accents.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><b>Why are you so awesome? </b></div>
<div>I can wiggle my ears. Hands free. Basically a super power, y&#8217;know? I got offered to be a member of the Avengers but it didn&#8217;t quite fit in my schedule so I had to turn them down.</div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><em>The days of remote positions being purely underpaid telemarketing jobs are gone.</em></p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.studyfinds.org/survey-one-five-office-employees-work-remotely/">One in five people work remotely</a> and over 50% of workers say their company has a work from home policy. What this remote work trend has created is an entirely new workplace lifestyle <em>and a chance for diversification like we have never seen before.</em></p>
<h3>With the ability to recruit from all over the world, we’re in the middle of two major shifts in the workforce.</h3>
<p><strong>Shift One:</strong> Companies have access to talent regardless of location</p>
<p><strong>Shift Two:</strong> Remote workers are having healthier and happier work experiences</p>
<p>InVision, a digital design platform, is looking toward the future and capitalizing on these shifts. They run an entire 700-person team fully remote — and they have been doing so for seven years.</p>
<p>InVision’s Chief People Officer, Mark Frein, told <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/invision-startup-all-employees-work-remotely-2018-9">Business Insider</a> he firmly believes hiring from any location gives InVision an edge as a technology company. Frein isn’t limited to finding talent in New York City and has diversified his workforce to talent around the world. He’s capitalizing on the statistics that show the value of remote workers (<a href="https://biz30.timedoctor.com/remote-workers-infographic/">click here for an infographic on remote work statistics</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li>Ninety-one percent of remote workers get more work done outside of the office</li>
<li>Remote workers are happier with their work than office workers</li>
<li>Remote workers feel more valued at work than office workers</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>“It’s about results, not where your IP address is. We care about what you’re able to do or achieve.” Mark Frein</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Companies like Basecamp, GitLab, Buffer and Splice have also embraced a fully remote team. Basecamp’s founder Jason Fried, transcribed his remote working business strategy into a best-selling book in 2009, <em>Rework</em>. In his book, he explained how remote work was an integral part of his company’s success.</p>
<p><strong>With only a remote team, Fried has amassed over three million Basecamp users.</strong></p>
<p>As the founder of <a href="https://cohoots.com/">CO+HOOTS</a>, a nationally ranked coworking office based in Phoenix, I watch business owners capitalize on having remote teams on a daily basis.</p>
<p>When it comes to innovation and closing business deals, the businesses capitalizing on the freedom that remote work provides are winning.</p>
<p><strong>The future of the workforce is here and this is how to capitalize on the opportunity of remote work.</strong></p>
<h3>Work Environment Will Be A Priority</h3>
<p>When working remotely, the work environment can vary from a table in a coffee shop, to a desk in a local library. Or, for some, it can be sitting in pajamas on the living room couch with your trusty cat pawing at your arm.</p>
<p>Josh Johnson, Senior Product Manager at Dribbble, runs a 50-person remote team from a coworking office. His experience with a remote team taught him that work environments aren’t a cookie cutter template, but a functioning part of an employee’s life. If employers can provide employees with the chance to find the optimal work environment, employers become catalyst to their employees’ health, productivity and longevity instead of inhibitors to their potential.</p>
<p><em>“No single way to work is appropriate for everyone. Some people are mentally and emotionally drained by sitting in a bustling, open office environment for nine hours every day. Others feel the same way about sitting alone at a desk in their home. Some people need to get away from their house to focus and be productive, others are happiest when they can take a 2pm conference call and enjoy a quick after school snack with their kids at 3pm.</em></p>
<p><em>We all win when we stop having tweet wars over which way is better and realize that the best possible job market is one that provides diverse opportunities to all types of people in all types of situations.”</em></p>
<p>The future of remote work depends on employers supporting their employees work productivity, no matter what form it takes.</p>
<p>Companies should take an interest in their employees’ remote office. Some are now providing laptops or a desktop computer. Others are giving stipends for home office furniture like standing desks. Even scheduling a weekly grocery delivery order to keep remote employees energized and healthy.</p>
<h3>Lower Overhead than Traditional Office Space</h3>
<p>All businesses are looking to create higher levels of happiness and lower their bottom line. Very rarely has the two ever come in one package, that is until coworking came around. Coworking space memberships often start at only $99 a month for individuals and allows companies to scale their team quickly and efficiently. This includes fast Wifi, utilities, office equipment, cleaning fees, access to networking events, free parking and more. Not to mention the biggest benefit — helping employees not feel so isolated. The overhead of a typical office is upwards of $3,000 not inclusive of all the utilities, maintenance, furniture and taxes. Keeping employees happy? Priceless.</p>
<p>Josh Padnick of Phoenix-based <a href="https://www.gruntwork.io/">Gruntwork</a> employs 14 remote workers and offers coworking as an employee benefit.</p>
<p><em>“We pay for everyone on our team to use a coworking space if they wish, and about half our team uses the benefit. The reality is that working from home all day every day, and then remaining at home at night can be draining and uninteresting. We also crave the in-person human connection and serendipity that comes from being in a physical workplace. Coworking is a great way to provide these things. You get the physical community, and yet your coworkers are distributed.”</em></p>
<p>Josh (full disclosure: he is a member at CO+HOOTS) spends 80% less revenue on office space than a traditional team does. When these savings are redirected to employee health and training, as well as business development, we see why remote teams are able to scale so quickly. Most spaces offer free trials for a day or a week, which give remote employees the opportunity to decide whether to see if being around other highly efficient workers helps them feel more efficient.</p>
<p>Coworking spaces are the done-for-you office space with professional development built in.</p>
<h3>Work Will No Longer Be 9–5</h3>
<p>The idea of the 9–5 work week is becoming less and less popular among employers. We’re finally realizing, <em>it’s not necessary.</em></p>
<p>Richard Branson recently wrote a piece <a href="https://www.virgin.com/richard-branson/way-we-all-work-going-change">on the future of the workplace</a>: “five days a week with two day weekends and a few weeks of holiday each year has become ingrained in society. However, it wasn’t always the case, and it won’t be in the future.”</p>
<p>Virgin happily applies an atypical work week with its employees and allows them to take off two months if they believe they need to.</p>
<p>The typical work schedule is an antiquated idea of how businesses should run. In most cases, there is no need for an employee to come in at a set period. Even more so, it would bode well for their health if they didn’t. Commuting to a job during “rush hour” is becoming increasingly stressful. Missing out on picking kids up for school does not equate to a great work-life balance. We have as a society switched from working hard to working smart and becoming a workforce that values measuring results over measuring time. It makes sense that 9–5 is dead.</p>
<h3>Hire for Diverse Opinions and Cultural Backgrounds</h3>
<p>What if each problem in your business was looked at by three experts with various backgrounds? Instead of getting the same answer three times, you’d have a variant of answers depending on the past experience of your experts.</p>
<p>The location agnostic factor of remote work means each of your experts stands on a different foundation. They all know the same information and can implement the same strategies but they may come to the project with three perspectives, three prior experiences and three ideas on solving any roadblocks along the way.</p>
<p>Diversity of opinions and cultural backgrounds is what Stephen Olmstead, Chief of Staff at <a href="https://www.invisionapp.com/">InVision</a>, attributes to the team’s ability to problem solve.</p></div>

<p>Each year, CO+HOOTS Foundation brings together the #yesphx business community for a spectacular event filled with memorable performances. On September 8, beginning at 6:30 pm, we will kick off the night by watching the most creative and innovative companies in Phoenix compete to become Lip Sync Champion!</p>
<p>This battle of the bold is bound to be entertaining. Each team competes for best performance and also for most funds raised! All proceeds will go toward supporting young entrepreneurs through the CO+HOOTS Foundation. Join us for an unforgettable night with outstanding performers who are dying to share their mad skills and take home the glory!</p>
<p>CO+HOOTS Foundation Board Co-Chair Jenny Poon Tells us more about what this event means to her.</p>
<p><strong>Amanda: This is the 3rd Annual Lip Sync Battle, I&#8217;d love to hear more about how this tradition got started?!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jenny: </strong>Well, it all started with the voices in my head. &#8230; Kidddddiiinnnnggggg! &#8230; Three years ago, we wanted to do something to celebrate Phoenix Councilmember Daniel Valenzuela&#8217;s birthday. He had been such a great resource for us as well as other individuals, organizations and companies in the Phoenix entrepreneurial and startup community. Here was a politician who didn&#8217;t act like one and really saw the value in our community in helping Phoenix grow. We really wanted to do something different, something no one else has done. Odeen (my husband) and I always enjoyed the Lip Sync Battles on Jim Fallon&#8217;s show. So it was a no brainer for us to gather other people in our community to battle it out via wacky lip sync performances to celebrate Daniel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A: The winning team was Great Hearts Academy last year, what team do you think will take home the Championship THIS year?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jenny: </strong>Well, CO+HOOTS can never win the competition, even though we always have the best performance. OK, that&#8217;s enough for my comedic career. I&#8217;m putting my (fake) money on Right This Minute/FOX team of Heather Lynn Herr and Jeff Moriarty. Heather can dance circles around you and Jeff is a genius. No pressure guys!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Amanda: What is your favorite thing about the Annual Lip Sync Battle?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jenny: </strong>Getting all of these professionals together in one room to just let loose and have fun. We are all so go-go-go during the week (and many weekends) that it&#8217;s hard to schedule time to just enjoy the company of like-minded people without our work life getting in the way. And because this is a lip syncing-dancing event, you get people out of their comfort zone &#8230; or you learn people&#8217;s hidden talents!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Amanda: What makes this year unique to the years prior? </strong></p>
<p><strong>Jenny: </strong>We are tripling down on making this Lip Sync Battle our primary event every year for the CO+HOOTS Foundation. To help raise funds to support the Foundation, its mission to provide equitable opportunity to entrepreneurship and our youth entrepreneurship program. All proceeds from the event will go toward benefitting that program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Amanda: So all proceeds from the event will go to young entrepreneurs? Very cool! </strong><strong>Are there any surprises in store for those attending?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jenny: </strong>Well, we might get several members of Phoenix City Council to get on stage if we hit our fundraising goals, including Mayor Greg Stanton! It&#8217;s going to be bonkers!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Amanda: Is this event public? How can people sign up for this?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jenny:</strong> They can sign up online through our events page and yes &#8212; everyone can join the fun!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Amanda: Where is it located?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jenny:</strong> It will be held at the FOUND:RE Hotel, 1100 N Central Ave, Phoenix, AZ 85003 on September 8, 2017, from 6:30- 9:30 pm!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Amanda: Can you tell us who the line up will be?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jenny:</strong> SBDC, SEED SPOT, Theraspecs, CO+HOOTS, Great Hearts Academy, Devin Del Palacio, CEI, ImproveAZ, Right This Minute, Downtown Phoenix Inc, and more!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Amanda: How can people get involved more CO+HOOTS Foundation?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jenny: </strong>First, they can get tickets to the Lip Sync Battle at bit.ly/colipsync as there will be plenty of opportunities to learn about the Foundation and our youth entrepreneurship program. They can also visit our website cohootsfdn.com where there will be ways to contact us for any opportunities to get involved.</p>

<h3><b>Why I Support The CO+HOOTS Foundation &#8212; Amanda</b></h3>
<p><span>When I volunteered for Youth StartUp Weekend at the CO+HOOTS Foundation, I had a glimpse into our children&#8217;s future. I witnessed each student pitching their ideas, creating products, and learning how to become a business owner! </span><span> Each going through their own transformation and realizing how confident they could be. This kind of thing is exactly why I admire and respect Jenny and Odeen at the CO+HOOTS Foundation. They think about the best ways to build community, communication, and a safe place to be yourself. Which is why I&#8217;d love for you to get to know them, and the community, at the 3rd Annual Lip Sync Battle. Don&#8217;t FOMO! We will be having a blast with talented people for a great cause.</span></p>

<div>Learn about CO+HOOTS&#8217; new Community Manager extraordinaire:</div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>Name:</strong> Melissa Fraley</div>
<div><b> </b></div>
<div><b>Nickname: </b>Mel, Boss Lady</div>
<div><b> </b></div>
<div><b>Hometown: </b>Peoria, AZ</div>
<div><b> </b></div>
<div><b>Why did you want to work at CO+HOOTS? </b></div>
<div>I wanted to be around people who are making a difference and passionate about what they do. I love the way that Jenny and Odeen embrace and encourage members and staff.  The kindness everyone has for each other here is amazing and infectious!</div>
<div><b> </b></div>
<div><b>What are your hopes and dreams at CO+HOOTS?</b></div>
<div>I want to get to know and learn from everyone here. The best thing about coming in each day is saying hi to my work family. I&#8217;m a giver and being able to give to such amazing people makes me happy. I want Cohootians to feel the love!</div>
<div><b> </b></div>
<div><b>Members in CO+HOOTS may be able to help you as well&#8230; What are your own personal hopes and dreams? </b></div>
<div>I love kids and animals! I think that education and reading skills are essential to fostering growth in our communities. I would love to start book club for kids! I am also an advocate for sustainability. Reuse, reduce and recycle! My son will often take items from the recycle bin and use if for something else, like a tissue box turned into a fake snow machine. I&#8217;m a very proud mama.</div>
<div><b> </b></div>
<div><b>If you had 100 billion dollars, you would&#8230;</b></div>
<div>Honestly, I&#8217;d keep what I would need for my family (car/house/trip to Disney World) then give the rest away. Donating the money to help fund education programs in AZ would be amazing and I&#8217;d give to animal shelters. Then probably start a farm. Yeah, definitely a farm with some goats, chickens, quail, a cow&#8230;</div>
<div><b> </b></div>
<div><b>What should the CO+HOOTS community know about you?</b></div>
<div>I fangirl pretty hard and I collect Funko Pops of my faves. My best day involves taking my boys to the park and then curling up with my favorite show/novel at the end of the day. And adult coloring books!! I love those.</div>
<div><b> </b></div>
<div><b>What is one thing people don&#8217;t know about you?</b></div>
<div>I was in swing dance club in high school.</div>
<div><b> </b></div>
<div><b>Why are you so awesome? </b></div>
<div>I was in swing dance club in high school.</div>
