				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><span>The glamour surrounding Silicon Valley belies a toxic work ethic, set in place by myths created in the tech boom of the 90s and cemented by the web boom of the 2000s.</span></p>
<p><span>Among the side effects of that fantasy? Millennials are entering the workplace with unrealistic and unsustainable attitudes on what being part of a startup means. … If you’re not working at all hours of the day, you’re not committed. … Only bro-grammers will make it big.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>All, wrong. </span></p>
<p><span>So, let’s put our hoodies away, take off our sustainably sourced sneakers and talk about what successful startup life is really like.</span></p>
<p><span></span></p>
<h2>THE LIES OF SILICON VALLEY</h2>
<h3><span></span></h3>
<h3><span>LIE #1: “FAKE IT UNTIL YOU MAKE IT.”</span></h3>
<p><span>Let me be clear, no one wants to hire someone who seems stymied and terrified by their workplace. But too many graduates enter the workforce riding a wave of bloated credentials, hoping if they bury their inexperience in enough buzz words, the HR manager won’t be able to separate fact from fiction. </span></p>
<p><span>What makes the “fake it until you make it” mantra so flawed is that while you can fake confidence, you can’t fake your competencies (at least not for long). When you misrepresent yourself, you set yourself up to erode the trust of anyone who invests in you. </span></p>
<p><span>Authenticity must be your core, whether it’s your resume or your business model. The days of bro-culture in tech and the “Old-white-guys Only” world of entrepreneurship are running out faster than bottled water at the FYRE Festival (that reference will not age well). </span></p>
<h3><span>LIE #2: YOU MUST SIGN YOUR LIFE OVER TO THE STARTUP</span></h3>
<p><span>A 40-hour week?!? Not in Silicon Valley pal! </span></p>
<p><span>Don’t feel like working nights and weekends? </span></p>
<p><span>One of those weak-willed sissies who want to see their spouses, kids or friends every day? </span></p>
<p><span>TOO BAD! </span></p>
<p><span>This is the world of startups. And in this world, no one sleeps and everyone is miserable until they instantly become gazillionaires. </span></p>
<p><span>This mindset must stop, not only for the good of your team but the good of startup culture.</span></p>
<p><span>Being married to your desk is a recipe for burnout and brain drain. Additionally, without a social life, you run the risk of disconnecting from your product’s users and startup investors. Some of our most valuable research is done simply by living in the world we seek to improve.</span></p>
<p><span></span></p>
<h3><span>LIE #3: &#8220;STARTUP&#8221; MEANS PROGRAMMING&#8221;</span></h3>
<p><span>Tech mastery is an important component of creating a scalable tech-based company, but it’s not the only important skill. </span></p>
<p><span>Tech skills are definitely an accelerating component. But most ideas are not unique because of the tech. They’re unique because of the solutions. </span></p>
<p><span>VRBO, for example, solves the problem of helping people find vacation rentals. The solution itself can be solved without tech, but tech allows for more people to access it. Success in startups depends on the innovation and the skills and backgrounds of those who develop solutions for it. You may notice once again this destroys the “fake it til’ you make it” myth.</span></p>
<p><span>A vision for something that can change the scope of an industry is not solely the realm of engineers and developers. Core competencies that are on par with or outrank programming expertise in building a startup include marketing, sales (Mark Cuban), finance (Mike Bloomberg), user experience (Steve Jobs) and product management (Interesting Name Not Found). </span></p>
<p><span>Rather than possessing one core skill (such as writing code), successful entrepreneurs possess a combination of skills and surround themselves with experts and culture motivators that accelerate the execution of their vision. </span></p>
<h3><span></span></h3>
<h3><span>WHY NOT FOLLOW THE EXAMPLE OF SILICON VALLEY?</span></h3>
<p><span>Our needs are different, our infrastructure is different and our definition of success is different. We must prioritize community building. We must include an examination of our unique population. We must consider community projects already in production (eg: mass transit, universities, a more walkable downtown). </span></p>
<p><span>The Valley of the Sun is attempting to employ an entirely different kind of entrepreneur, engineer and innovator. In fact, tier 2 cities and emerging markets are becoming way more attractive to talent and a massive migration is beginning. People are choosing a different path than the above hustle and grind expectations. The workforce is demanding freedom — financial freedom, social freedom to manage to their time, and the freedom to choose what drives them. These are the key benefits of being in an emerging city. Not only is the cost of living incredibly affordable so is the ability to live in/near urban areas, where most business opportunities often cluster. These things are all possible in markets where cities are allowed to take risks and be different. Where we aren’t chasing what we could be, but are comfortable owning that we are a bit nerdy and are the only ones who think it’s a dry heat. But really it is.</span></p>
<p><span>When the goals and priorities of Millennials and GenZ do not match those of Boomers and Gen X, how could we imagine the tactics would?</span></p>
<p><span>So let Silicon Valley be Silicon Valley and let Phoenix be Phoenix. </span></p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><em>The days of remote positions being purely underpaid telemarketing jobs are gone.</em></p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.studyfinds.org/survey-one-five-office-employees-work-remotely/">One in five people work remotely</a> and over 50% of workers say their company has a work from home policy. What this remote work trend has created is an entirely new workplace lifestyle <em>and a chance for diversification like we have never seen before.</em></p>
<h3>With the ability to recruit from all over the world, we’re in the middle of two major shifts in the workforce.</h3>
<p><strong>Shift One:</strong> Companies have access to talent regardless of location</p>
<p><strong>Shift Two:</strong> Remote workers are having healthier and happier work experiences</p>
<p>InVision, a digital design platform, is looking toward the future and capitalizing on these shifts. They run an entire 700-person team fully remote — and they have been doing so for seven years.</p>
<p>InVision’s Chief People Officer, Mark Frein, told <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/invision-startup-all-employees-work-remotely-2018-9">Business Insider</a> he firmly believes hiring from any location gives InVision an edge as a technology company. Frein isn’t limited to finding talent in New York City and has diversified his workforce to talent around the world. He’s capitalizing on the statistics that show the value of remote workers (<a href="https://biz30.timedoctor.com/remote-workers-infographic/">click here for an infographic on remote work statistics</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li>Ninety-one percent of remote workers get more work done outside of the office</li>
<li>Remote workers are happier with their work than office workers</li>
<li>Remote workers feel more valued at work than office workers</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>“It’s about results, not where your IP address is. We care about what you’re able to do or achieve.” Mark Frein</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Companies like Basecamp, GitLab, Buffer and Splice have also embraced a fully remote team. Basecamp’s founder Jason Fried, transcribed his remote working business strategy into a best-selling book in 2009, <em>Rework</em>. In his book, he explained how remote work was an integral part of his company’s success.</p>
<p><strong>With only a remote team, Fried has amassed over three million Basecamp users.</strong></p>
<p>As the founder of <a href="https://cohoots.com/">CO+HOOTS</a>, a nationally ranked coworking office based in Phoenix, I watch business owners capitalize on having remote teams on a daily basis.</p>
<p>When it comes to innovation and closing business deals, the businesses capitalizing on the freedom that remote work provides are winning.</p>
<p><strong>The future of the workforce is here and this is how to capitalize on the opportunity of remote work.</strong></p>
<h3>Work Environment Will Be A Priority</h3>
<p>When working remotely, the work environment can vary from a table in a coffee shop, to a desk in a local library. Or, for some, it can be sitting in pajamas on the living room couch with your trusty cat pawing at your arm.</p>
<p>Josh Johnson, Senior Product Manager at Dribbble, runs a 50-person remote team from a coworking office. His experience with a remote team taught him that work environments aren’t a cookie cutter template, but a functioning part of an employee’s life. If employers can provide employees with the chance to find the optimal work environment, employers become catalyst to their employees’ health, productivity and longevity instead of inhibitors to their potential.</p>
<p><em>“No single way to work is appropriate for everyone. Some people are mentally and emotionally drained by sitting in a bustling, open office environment for nine hours every day. Others feel the same way about sitting alone at a desk in their home. Some people need to get away from their house to focus and be productive, others are happiest when they can take a 2pm conference call and enjoy a quick after school snack with their kids at 3pm.</em></p>
<p><em>We all win when we stop having tweet wars over which way is better and realize that the best possible job market is one that provides diverse opportunities to all types of people in all types of situations.”</em></p>
<p>The future of remote work depends on employers supporting their employees work productivity, no matter what form it takes.</p>
<p>Companies should take an interest in their employees’ remote office. Some are now providing laptops or a desktop computer. Others are giving stipends for home office furniture like standing desks. Even scheduling a weekly grocery delivery order to keep remote employees energized and healthy.</p>
<h3>Lower Overhead than Traditional Office Space</h3>
<p>All businesses are looking to create higher levels of happiness and lower their bottom line. Very rarely has the two ever come in one package, that is until coworking came around. Coworking space memberships often start at only $99 a month for individuals and allows companies to scale their team quickly and efficiently. This includes fast Wifi, utilities, office equipment, cleaning fees, access to networking events, free parking and more. Not to mention the biggest benefit — helping employees not feel so isolated. The overhead of a typical office is upwards of $3,000 not inclusive of all the utilities, maintenance, furniture and taxes. Keeping employees happy? Priceless.</p>
<p>Josh Padnick of Phoenix-based <a href="https://www.gruntwork.io/">Gruntwork</a> employs 14 remote workers and offers coworking as an employee benefit.</p>
<p><em>“We pay for everyone on our team to use a coworking space if they wish, and about half our team uses the benefit. The reality is that working from home all day every day, and then remaining at home at night can be draining and uninteresting. We also crave the in-person human connection and serendipity that comes from being in a physical workplace. Coworking is a great way to provide these things. You get the physical community, and yet your coworkers are distributed.”</em></p>
<p>Josh (full disclosure: he is a member at CO+HOOTS) spends 80% less revenue on office space than a traditional team does. When these savings are redirected to employee health and training, as well as business development, we see why remote teams are able to scale so quickly. Most spaces offer free trials for a day or a week, which give remote employees the opportunity to decide whether to see if being around other highly efficient workers helps them feel more efficient.</p>
<p>Coworking spaces are the done-for-you office space with professional development built in.</p>
<h3>Work Will No Longer Be 9–5</h3>
<p>The idea of the 9–5 work week is becoming less and less popular among employers. We’re finally realizing, <em>it’s not necessary.</em></p>
<p>Richard Branson recently wrote a piece <a href="https://www.virgin.com/richard-branson/way-we-all-work-going-change">on the future of the workplace</a>: “five days a week with two day weekends and a few weeks of holiday each year has become ingrained in society. However, it wasn’t always the case, and it won’t be in the future.”</p>
<p>Virgin happily applies an atypical work week with its employees and allows them to take off two months if they believe they need to.</p>
<p>The typical work schedule is an antiquated idea of how businesses should run. In most cases, there is no need for an employee to come in at a set period. Even more so, it would bode well for their health if they didn’t. Commuting to a job during “rush hour” is becoming increasingly stressful. Missing out on picking kids up for school does not equate to a great work-life balance. We have as a society switched from working hard to working smart and becoming a workforce that values measuring results over measuring time. It makes sense that 9–5 is dead.</p>
<h3>Hire for Diverse Opinions and Cultural Backgrounds</h3>
<p>What if each problem in your business was looked at by three experts with various backgrounds? Instead of getting the same answer three times, you’d have a variant of answers depending on the past experience of your experts.</p>
<p>The location agnostic factor of remote work means each of your experts stands on a different foundation. They all know the same information and can implement the same strategies but they may come to the project with three perspectives, three prior experiences and three ideas on solving any roadblocks along the way.</p>
<p>Diversity of opinions and cultural backgrounds is what Stephen Olmstead, Chief of Staff at <a href="https://www.invisionapp.com/">InVision</a>, attributes to the team’s ability to problem solve.</p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p>“Being locationally agnostic is not just good for talent, it’s also good for culture. Hiring across the globe ensures a diverse set of opinions and cultural backgrounds are represented in our approach to solving problems.”</p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_3  et_pb_text_align_left et_pb_bg_layout_light">
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p>Working with 700 people from around the world means that Stephen’s team isn’t built on the foundation of one person’s experience. It’s built on the foundation of 700. Which foundation sounds sturdier?</p>
<p><strong>The future of the workforce is going to consist of happier workers that are location independent and aren’t hindered by their socioeconomic status, gender or race.</strong></p>
<p>Companies will enjoy the benefits reaped when workers aren’t forced to show up to an uninspiring cubicle-laden dungeon with barely any windows after sitting in hours of traffic. They’ll see more innovation by hopping on a Zoom call for a team meeting and seeing the variety of faces on the screen, all with new experiences and ideas from their varying locations of the world.</p>
<p>Companies comprised of an inclusive and diverse workforce that supports happy workers is the future of work we all deserve.</p>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p>When we moved to our new space on 11th Street and Washington last year, we went in with the idea that we are the home for independents. We quickly saw our lovely independent workers, entrepreneurs, solopreneurs and startups grow. And we&#8217;re talking BIG GROWTH. With the power of our talented Phoenix community behind them, our companies expanded. And now we&#8217;re seeing a need for more &#8220;team space.&#8221;</p>
<p>OK, those are all the hints we&#8217;re giving about the next phase of CO+HOOTS. But until then, for those who are too excited to wait, we have ONE office available for a talented team ready to join the coworking movement. Be a big part of our growing community and at the forefront of entrepreneurship in Arizona.<br /> Some deets about the available private office at CO+HOOTS:</p>
<ol>
<li>Private space</li>
<li>White boards</li>
<li>Furniture included</li>
<li>Private entry</li>
<li>An awesome community</li>
<li>Seats 6-8 people</li>
<li>Full access to the entire 4,500 sq. ft space and three meeting rooms</li>
